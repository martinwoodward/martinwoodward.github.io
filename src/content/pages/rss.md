# RSS Feeds

Stay updated with the latest posts by subscribing to our RSS feeds. Choose the feed that best suits your interests:

## Main Feeds

### [All Posts RSS Feed](/rss.xml)
Subscribe to get all published blog posts delivered to your RSS reader.

# Category Feeds

You can also subscribe to specific category feeds to get posts only from topics you're interested in:

- Photography: `/rss/photography.xml`
- Test: `/rss/test.xml`

*Note: Category feeds are automatically generated based on the categories used in blog posts. Replace spaces with hyphens and use lowercase letters in the URL.*

## How to Use RSS Feeds

1. **Copy the RSS feed URL** you want to subscribe to
2. **Open your RSS reader** (such as Feedly, Inoreader, or any other RSS client)
3. **Add a new subscription** and paste the feed URL
4. **Start receiving updates** whenever new posts are published

## What is RSS?

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed format that allows you to stay updated with your favorite websites without having to manually check them. When you subscribe to an RSS feed, you'll automatically receive new content in your RSS reader as soon as it's published.
