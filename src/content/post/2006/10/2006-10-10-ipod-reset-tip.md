I've used my old iPod Mini nearly every day for 2 years (since I [discovered Podcasting for the first time](http://www.woodwardweb.com/technology/000058.html)).  Tomorrow I have a rather long car journey ahead of me and I have been saving up a few episodes of [.NET Rocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/), [Slacker Astronomy](http://www.slackerastronomy.org/wordpress/index.php), [In Business](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/news/inbusiness/inbusiness.shtml) and a new episode of [Today in Parliament](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/radio4/todayinparliament/rss.xml) for the trip.  However - when I tried to switch on my iPod for my evening walk last night it just wasn't playing.  I figured that the battery had finally given up the ghost after all those recharge cycles - while a little annoyed that I was going to have to go back to the radio for my long car journey, I wasn't that unhappy as it meant I now had an excuse to get a brand new iPod. 

However, this morning I did a bit of digging around and eventually stumbled on the [following tip from the Apple Site](http://depot.info.apple.com/ipod/):-  

Slide the Hold switch and check the screen. 
If your iPod is frozen or won't turn on, connect your iPod to your computer, then press and hold the "Menu" and "Select" buttons simultaneously for 10 seconds to reset the iPod 

Worked just fine for me, my iPod is now charging from the mains adapter and looks set to last me a while longer - however I think I might treat myself to a new MP3 player of some sort soon - but now I can take my time researching :-)
