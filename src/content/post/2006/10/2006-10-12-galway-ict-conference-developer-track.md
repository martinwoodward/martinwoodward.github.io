Thanks to all the people who came along to the Developer Track of todays conference in Galway.  It was great to see such a mix of people with different experience of .NET and Team System in General - but also nice to see some Java folks.  Here are m y slides as promised:-

[Agenda Slides (184 KB)](http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/Developer_Seminars_Agenda.pdf) – This was the timings of the day as planned…
[Source Control and Life Cycle Management With TFS (816 KB)](http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/SourceControlLifeCycleManagementlWithTFS.pdf) – As so much of this demo was interactive, the slide deck may not be too useful, however the links are included at the end in case you missed them.
[Team System Adoption (1680 KB)](http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/TeamSystemAdoption.pdf) – Some practical advice on adopting Team System in the average organisation.

The sessions were also all recorded so I will link to them on my blog as they are published.  Thanks again to all those attending and a special thanks to [Eric Lee](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlee/) for travelling such a long way just to talk.  Hope everyone found it a useful and enjoyable event.
