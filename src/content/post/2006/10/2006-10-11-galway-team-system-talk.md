Tomorrow (October 12th), I'll be talking at the first annual [ICT Conference in Galway](http://www.itag.ie/Conference2006/tabid/335/Default.aspx), Ireland.  While having me attend is probably reason for you to stay away, [Eric Lee](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlee/) (PM on Visual Studio Team System) is flying in from Redmond especially to talk. 

Eric is one of the best presenters on Team System that I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing.  Also, as a senior manager on the team, it is your opportunity to ask questions face to face and influence the team as they plan out what to include in future releases of Team System.  Also presenting in the [Developer Track](http://www.itag.ie/Home/tabid/81/ctl/View/mid/475/Event/237/Date/20061009/Start/200610120830/End/200610121800/Default.aspx) is [Rob Burke](http://blogs.msdn.com/robburke/), who is just a pleasure to listen to.  To be honest, it's a conference that I agreed to talk at just so I could listen to the other speakers - hopefully my sections will be worth listening to as well.

The conference is being held all-day at the Galway Bay Hotel.  Take a look at the [ITAG site for more details](http://www.itag.ie/Conference2006/tabid/335/Default.aspx).  I'm currently sitting in the hotel and it is very nice (with fast internet access) - however it was crazily hard to find a map to the place - so thanks to the power of Live Writer, one is included with this post.  (BTW - [http://local.live.com](http://local.live.com) currently has by far the best mapping data I have found for Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the map print utility is great.) 

Anyway - as usual, the slides will be available on this site in a follow up post sometime tomorrow.
