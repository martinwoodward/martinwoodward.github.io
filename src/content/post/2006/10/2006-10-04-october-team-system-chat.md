Just a reminder that the next Team System chat is this afternoon. Not only is this a great opportunity to talk about the Orcas CTP and the "Data Dude" edition of Team System, but any other questions you have. The Team Chats are a great way to talk directly to the product group and to influence the direction of the product in the future.
