Tonight, I finally sat down and recompiled the [CruiseControl.NET plugin](http://vstsplugins.sourceforge.net/) to work with the RC version of the Team Foundation Server API.

Turns out there was only one change – the TeamFoundationServer object now has a public constructor to pass the credentials to rather than using the factory as I has previously been doing. I also put a quick fix in there, but I really want to re-write the whole thing. Looking back at the use of the client API it is very naive, there would be a ton of improvements I would love to do to it to make it faster by actually using some of the great features that Version Control in Team Foundation Server gives you. I also want to talk to the PublishTestResults service. Hey ho – so little time so many projects…

Anyway, cruise on over to the [VSTSPlugins](http://vstsplugins.sourceforge.net/) project to find out more.
