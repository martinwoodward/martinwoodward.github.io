Just been listening to an excellent programme from [BBC Radio 4 - The X Factor](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/thexfactor.shtml).  Not a story of wanabe pop stars, but a tale of what it is like to go into space and how the experience is about to open up to more normal people.  It is presented by veteran astronaut Jeff Hoffman, who is now professor of astronautics at MIT.  Sadly the programme is not available to download as an MP3, but you can listen to it through RealPlayer using the BBC's listen again service.
