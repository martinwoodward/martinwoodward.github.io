Usually, I am very good at the 24 hour clock. It comes from a childhood of setting the VCR because my parents just could never figure it out. However I turned up for my 9.30 flight this evening, only to find I had read my tickets wrong and it was actually 19.30. Luckilly they were fully flexible tickets because I had to book them at the last minute, however it was the final flight of the day and so now I'll not be getting home until Saturday evening - missing the entire St Patrick's Day celebrations on Friday. What an Idiot I am - playing Check-In Chicken used to be one of my favourite games, but missing a flight home is never as much fun as missing the flight out. To improve my mood and help me sleep I've been investigating how to say [Cheers in multiple languages](http://www.awa.dk/glosary/slainte.htm). Sláinte!
