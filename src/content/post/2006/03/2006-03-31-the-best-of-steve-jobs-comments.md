With Apple about to celebrate it's 30th Anniversary, Wired is running a piece on the [best Steve Jobs' comments ever](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/mac/1,70512-0.html).  While I don't particularly like the proprietary way in which Apple goes about things - you have to admire the man's presentation skills, charisma, vision and the ability to go from a two man in a garage team to being a CEO.  Also, there ain't no denying that his companies products are awfully nice looking and the consumer experience of buying technology from the Apple store compared with [Best Buy](http://www.bestbuy.com/) or [Dixons](http://www.dixons.co.uk/) is like the difference between buying jewelry from [Tiffany](http://www.tiffany.com/)'s instead of [Elizabeth Duke](http://www.argos.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ArgosBrowseCounts?catalogId=4501&storeId=10001&categoryId=35755&languageId=-1&top=N). The following are my personal favourites quotes from the [Wired piece](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/mac/1,70512-0.html):-

"We made the buttons on the screen look so good you'll want to lick them."
"I've always wanted to own and control the primary technology in everything we do."
"Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R&D. It's not about money. It's about the people you have, how you're led, and how much you get it."
"It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them."
"It comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don't get on the wrong track or try to do too much."
"It is hard to think that a $2 billion company with 4,300-plus people couldn't compete with six people in blue jeans."
"Why would I ever want to run Disney? Wouldn't it make more sense just to sell them Pixar and retire?"
