After a [somewhat public call to action](http://software.ericsink.com/entries/Ben_Blogging.html), [Ian Olsen](http://ianolsen.wordpress.com/) is now blogging. Ian works over on the [SourceGear](http://www.sourcegear.com/) side of the company and will be a familiar name to those of you subscribed to the [CruiseControl.NET](http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET) mailing lists. If you have the time pop along and pay him a visit. If you are wondering, his desk is probably about another 10 feet closer to [Eric](http://software.ericsink.com/)'s than [Ben](http://www.benpryor.com/blog/)'s.
