[Jeff Atwood has posted a sample](http://blogs.vertigosoftware.com/teamsystem/archive/2006/02/27/2302.aspx) to allow you to implement what has got to be the single most requested check-in policy for Team System, forcing a user to comment their change. Based on some [earlier](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmanning/archive/2006/02/02/523125.aspx) [posts](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmanning/archive/2006/01/21/515858.aspx) by [James Manning](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmanning/), Jeff's download also contains some good example check-in policies. To be honest, if James and Jeff's examples where included in the standard TFS install then most customers I have worked with wouldn't need to go near implementing their own policies.

If you are writing your own check-in policies then I encourage you to keep an eye on [James Manning](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmanning/)'s blog. He frequently offers tidbits of advice above that of the [official guidance](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181281.aspx).
