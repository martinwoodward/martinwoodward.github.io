Just to let folks know I’ll be popping over to attend [SD West](http://www.sdexpo.com/).  I’ll be doing a technical session on Thursday morning and I’ll be at the [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com/) booth in the Microsoft Pavilion the rest of the time.  If you are attending SD West then pop along to my session (I’ll need the moral support at that time in the morning) or drop by the booth for a chat.  Otherwise if you are in the Santa Clara / San Jose area between 13th – 16th March then let me know if you fancy meeting up for a beer or two.

Thursday, March 16, 8:30am - 10:00am
Drawing on real world scenarios, this session will explain how to deploy Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server across your enterprise. It will focus in on a realistic adoption route and demonstrate the alternative methods available to connect into your Team System Environment. Particular focus will be given to the Teamprise suite of products which allows Team Foundation access from non-Windows platforms and from inside Eclipse.
