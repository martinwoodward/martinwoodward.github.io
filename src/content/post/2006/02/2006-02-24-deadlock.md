I’ve been coding for around 25 years, since my parents bought me a [VIC-20](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20). I think it was probably a similar advert to [this one](http://www.archive.org/download/CommodoreVic20CommercialwithWilliamShatnerfromtheyear1980Iactuallyhadoneofthesethings/vic201982.wmv) by William Shatner that convinced them to buy it after seeing how much time my borther and I spent playing with our [Atari 2600](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600). It was a sizable investment in new technology for them at the time, but one that has helped me to earn my living for over 10 years now. In that time I’ve written many multi-threaded applications and considered myself reasonably “thread-savvy”. Most of the stuff has been web based applications but I’ve done my fair share of client side work before and I’m currently [doing a lot of it](http://www.teamprise.com/).

This morning I encountered a [Deadlock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock)ing problem for the very first time outside of a question in a technical interview, in fact if it had not been preparing for technical interviews then I may never have even come across the term before. As I did my degree in [Physics](http://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/) and not Computer Science, I’ve always had a bit of a weak spot around my use of formal computing terms – sadly my knowledge of Physics isn’t much better as I spent most of my time in the [college bar and the JCR](http://www.dur.ac.uk/StChads/buildings.html). The reason I’ve probably only come across a real deadlock now is that most of my professional life has been spent inside J2EE application servers or on the server side of .NET where you tend to be deliberately insulated from such things.

Anyway, thought it was worth a post to commemorate this day – it took me a while to track down (would have been longer if it wasn’t for the debugger in Eclipse). Had I not spent the odd day here and there preparing for technical interviews it probably would have took me longer. You never know – one of these days I might actually write a real [binary search algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search) or use some of the other interview favourites…
