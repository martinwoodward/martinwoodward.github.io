[](http://www.teamprise.com/)Preview 6 of Teamprise is now available for registered users to [download](http://www.teamprise.com/preview-register.py) (registration is free). This release is compatible with the RC version of Team Foundation Server only - Beta 3 and Beta 3 refresh users should stick with Preview 5 or [upgrade TFS now to claim your free T-shirt](http://blogs.msdn.com/robcaron/archive/2006/02/17/534416.aspx).

Apart from the move from Beta 3 to RC, we've been busy adding some more Work Item Tracking features to the product to avoid you having to leave the IDE. We've also fixed a ton of bugs and added loads of functionality around the edge cases. 

Now we are heads down concentrating on improving quality ready for the V1 build.  It’s really getting exciting!  I use our plugin for my day to day development and I really love it. The Pending Changes View rocks.  Anyway, I encourage you to take a look at the preview version, and maybe even try it out on Linux or one of those shiny Macs – that is guaranteed to make you say what [Soma](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/default.aspx) did when he saw Teamprise on Ubuntu during the [VSLive keynote](http://www.woodwardweb.com/teamprise/000177.html)… “Wow!”.
