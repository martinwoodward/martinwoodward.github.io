[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/teamprise2.png)[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/teamprise2.png)In a few hours, I’ll be getting on a flight to TechEd 2006 in Boston.  If you are coming along then make sure to stop by the [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com/) booth and get a preview of Teamprise 2.0.  As it is just about to get it’s public unveiling I can finally talk about what has been keeping us so busy for the past couple of months.  Things are coming along so well, I just had to share some of the cool stuff we’ve been working on.  Take a look at the screen-shot or watch a [quick run-through](http://www.woodwardweb.com/teamprise/QuickTeampriseTour.html) I recorded while I was practising for the show and let us know what you think.  The [demo shows the key features of the plug-in in just over 5 minutes](http://www.woodwardweb.com/teamprise/QuickTeampriseTour.html).  It is pretty big (about 15Mb) so you’ll have to be patient while it loads.

As you’ll be able to see we’ve been busy adding features since 1.0 shipped.  We are making sure everything the developer needs to work with Team Foundation Server is inside the Eclipse plug-in.  We now have work item editing support along with access to the Team Explorer view (including the Windows Sharepoint Services document libraries and access to Reports).  I’m just incredibly impressed with the Work Item Editor work that [Ben](http://www.benpryor.com/blog/) has been leading the development on.  It is just soo good that I frequently forget which IDE I am in – Visual Studio 2005 or Eclipse and I have to double check to make sure.

Most of the source control features are already working very well in Teamprise 1.0 – however 2.0 gives you Shelve and Un-Shelve directly from inside Eclipse.  Version 2.0 will also have branch, merge and label support along with many other features, performance improvements and improved connectivity.  It’s not just the graphical clients that have been getting functionality added – there are some cool new features available from the command line including work item capabilities that are just super cool.

As you can tell, I’m quite excited about going to TechEd and showing everyone the cool new things we’ve been working on.  It is a nervous sort of excitement as this will be the first public outing for the new functionality but I really want to hear what everyone thinks.  It’ll also be nice to put faces to some of the people I’ve been talking with and folks who’s blogs I have been reading over the past year or so.  If you happen to read my blog and are at the show then do please drop by and say “Hi”.
