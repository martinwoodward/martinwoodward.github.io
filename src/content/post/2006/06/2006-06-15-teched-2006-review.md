I’d planned on giving a blow by blow account of TechEd 2006, but it was so amazingly busy I just never got time.  I sat down at my laptop on Wednesday night and then woke up an hour later at the keyboard – so I figured I needed to sleep.  During the day, the [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com/) booth was unbelievably busy.  To all those folks that dropped by the booth to say “Hi” – thanks very much.  It was so nice to meet everyone and also nice to show off what we have been working so hard on.  I spend most of my time working out of my office in the UK so it was fantastic to be among so many bright people.   

This show, rather than having to educate people about Team Foundation Server most folks coming up to the booth already had a TFS instance up and running and were wanting to extend the usage of it across their enterprise.  I managed to catch a few sessions including an overview of the absolutely fantastic features in the “Data Dude” SKU.  

The best part of the conference was finally meeting face to face with all the people I’ve corresponded with of TFS related issues over the past year and also meeting up with old friends.  I can’t express how invigorating the whole week was and how excited I am about the next year.

Best swag of the week for me was the WinFX team who were giving away little flashlights with the WinFX logo.  The logo is now defunct as it will soon be .NET 3.0 – I guess they were trying to get rid of them so I picked up a couple.
