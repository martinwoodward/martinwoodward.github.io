I’ve just learnt something today from our resident tech-writer that I feel needs sharing. Apparently it is “old” to put two spaces after a full-stop (or “period” for you American’s out there).  See the following articles for evidence:-

When I learnt to type it was with a typewriter.  I was 5 and I used a lot of Tipex.  As readers of my blog will see – I’m not particularly gifted in the spelling / grammar / correct use of the apostrophe department. I quickly moved into the world of word-processors when we upgraded from the [Vic-20](http://www.vintage-computer.com/vic20.shtml) to my [Commodore PLUS 4](http://www.vintage-computer.com/commodoreplus4.shtml) and I never looked back. I found that if I typed up my homework assignments for school, not only was it quicker than hand-writing them (especially when doing multiple drafts), but I frequently got higher grades because the amazing presentation of those new-fangled dot-matrix printers would impress the teachers.

Today I earn my living by typing (all be it typing out code, with infrequent and badly spelt comments). I type over 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for money – not including all the typing I do for pleasure. From here on in, I’m going to try to stop doing a double space after the full-stop but it will take me some time to reverse over 25–years of conditioning.

The question that is really worrying me is what other typing faux-pas have I been committing for the past 25 years?  Actually, I’m also a little worried that I seem to have an obsession with office equipment.  I used to play with a type-writer as a child and I still enjoy browsing through stationary catalogues.  That’s not normal is it.
