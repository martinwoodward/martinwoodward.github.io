I recently did an interview for [Port 25](http://port25.technet.com/default.aspx) (the website for Microsoft’s Open Source Lab). If you would like to listen to the podcast then it is now available [here](http://port25.technet.com/archive/2006/07/21/Podcast_3A00_-Accessing-VS-Team-Foundation-Server-from-Mac_2C00_-UNIX-or-Linux-through-Eclipse.aspx).

The interview was recorded in a week when NTLM authentication was high on my mind (as you can tell). However [Ed](http://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/) has since done a [fantastic job](http://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/2006/07/teamprise_11_released.html) and led the work to implement the full NTLM stack based on details gleaned from the excellent book “[Implementing CIFS, by Christopher R. Hertel](http://ubiqx.org/cifs/Book.html)”. This book is not the “official” specification, but is very readable and is drawn from the work done by the [Samba](http://www.samba.org/) team. As discussed in the podcast, one of the interesting things I learnt it that Microsoft’s Open Source Lab’s team have actually contributed some patches into the Samba group – which is a good thing. Ed’s work has now been [released](http://www.teamprise.com/download/) in Version 1.1 of [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com/)[ ](http://www.teamprise.com/)– one of those new features that nobody will really notice, it _just works_.

Anyway, feel free to listen to the [podcast](http://port25.technet.com/archive/2006/07/21/Podcast_3A00_-Accessing-VS-Team-Foundation-Server-from-Mac_2C00_-UNIX-or-Linux-through-Eclipse.aspx). While I have been a keen listener to podcasts [since the beginning,](http://www.woodwardweb.com/technology/000058.html) this is the first time my voice has appeared in one (and I doubt I will make a habit of it). However, hopefully you won’t find it as painful to listen to as I did.
