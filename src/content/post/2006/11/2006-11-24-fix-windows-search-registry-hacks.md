On the off chance that you read my blog and not [Scott Hanselman's](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) (shame on you) then I wanted to draw your attention to some invaluable [registry tweaks he just posted](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/53369771/HowToDisableWindowsDesktopSearchExplorerIntegrationAfterInstallingOffice2007.aspx) - especially if you've been forced into installing Windows Desktop Search 3.0 to enable Outlook Instant Search - but also if you are a developer. 

The [first](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/53369771/HowToDisableWindowsDesktopSearchExplorerIntegrationAfterInstallingOffice2007.aspx) is how to make the normal windows search the default again after installing Windows Desktop Search, the [second](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/53369771/HowToDisableWindowsDesktopSearchExplorerIntegrationAfterInstallingOffice2007.aspx) is how to get the full text search to search through *every* file (such as .cs or .java ones).  The latter tip is one I always do when I build a new Windows box, but the former is a new annoyance I was struggling with.  I can see why the new behaviors are the defaults for "regular" users - but it would have been nice if there was a way to change the defaults in the UI without resorting to regedit...
