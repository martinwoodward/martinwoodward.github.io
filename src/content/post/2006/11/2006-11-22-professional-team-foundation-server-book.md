I've had the pleasure meeting all three of the authors through my involvement with Team System and I certainly respect what they have to say.  I also have high hopes that the topic will be presented in an easy to understand way with plenty of good advice born out of real experience in the field. 

My copy is on order from Amazon - due to arrive December 4th.  I'll be sure to post a review once I've read it.
