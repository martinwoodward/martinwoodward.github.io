This morning I took the sort and pleasurable flight over from Belfast to Barcelona to join the [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com/) / [SourceGear](http://www.sourcegear.com) advance party ready to set up at the [TechEd Developers](http://www.mseventseurope.com/Teched/06/Pre/defaultDev.aspx) conference in Barcelona. As usual, the Teamprise marketing manager has done us proud and we're into a Hotel directly opposite the conference centre. After the long bus rides of TechEd 2006 in Boston - the trip to work this week is going to be a breeze. The mini-bar in the hotel is actually complimentary and they restock it if you leave your room - how cool is that ??

I'm pretty excited about this conference. The traffic by the booth will probably not be as busy - Microsoft seem to be concentrating on Team System for Database Professionals this week so I don't expect we'll be showing up any [keynotes](http://www.woodwardweb.com/teamprise/000177.html) this time (when your product has a Microsoft VP on stage [demonstrating your product on Ubuntu Linux](http://www.woodwardweb.com/teamprise/000177.html), it tends to get a few people dropping by :-) ). However, I'm really looking forward to talking with folks about Teamprise and Team System. We're based in stand B24 in the Visual Studio Partner zone of the exhibition hall (near the ask the experts section) - so do drop by. I'll also be giving a demo on the stage in the partner zone at 14.45 on Wednesday, if you happen to be between sessions at the time then please drop by to lend some moral support.

I'm hoping to see some old Team System community faces, as well as putting some faces to some names. Not to mention the parties...

If you are coming along to TechEd Developers in Barcelona then drop by the booth and say "hola". I'm going to be brave and load up the latest build of V2.0 onto the demo machines so you'll get an exclusive look at the latest and greatest version in what will be it's last public outing before we ship V2.0.
