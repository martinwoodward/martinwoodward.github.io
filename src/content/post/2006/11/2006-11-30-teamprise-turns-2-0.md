Tuesday marked the beginning of my second year with [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com/) and today I'm very happy to report that we have [just released](http://www.teamprise.com/news/2006/11/teamprise_20_now_available.html) [Teamprise 2.0](http://www.teamprise.com/).  To celebrate I thought I'd give you a quick run through of some of my favorite features.
