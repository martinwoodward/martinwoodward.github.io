[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/HomefromTechEd2006Developers_9F0A/booth%5B1%5D.jpg)I'm back home from sunny Barcelona, and just wanted to post a quick note to thank all the folks who stopped by. It was great to meet some old friends again, and also to make some new ones.

The week went very well after such an inauspicious start. After my power-supply incident, I went out for some lovely tapas and drinks at the MVP dinner, however I must have caught something or eaten a dodgy prawn as I woke in the night and was violently ill. I stumbled into the conference centre for a full day at the booth on only 2 hours sleep - sorry if you came to speak to me on Tuesday...

After that things went really well. I noticed a huge difference in Team Foundation Server awareness from previous shows. Conversations typically used to be like this:-

**Person**: Oooh, a that's a nice shiney Mac - what's that doing at a Microsft show?
**Me**: Have you heard of Team System?
**Person**: Eh?

Now it is more along the lines of:-

**Person**: Oooh, that's a nice shiney Mac, what's it's Windows Vista Experience Index?
**Me**: Have you heard of Team System?
**Person**: Duh, of course - we've been running TFS for a while now.

Needless to say, there were a lot more people immediately interested in not only our product but also some people who just wanted to see something they had heard about actually working in the flesh. While the demo on Windows is always pretty interesting, with the resounding sentiment being "it looks just the same". On the Mac, the same things just look too good to actually be true. A year on, I still love talking to Team Foundation Server from the Mac, it just shouldn't work as well as it does - kinda feels naughty. Fellow Team System MVP [Lorenzo Barbieri](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/lbarbieri/) did a [great write-up from the conference floor](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/lbarbieri/archive/2006/11/08/54193.aspx) on his impressions of the Mac client.

Anyway, back to work and we are all heads down putting the finishing touches to V2.0. I'm looking forward to blogging some more about that soon :-)
