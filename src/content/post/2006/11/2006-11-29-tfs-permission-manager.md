It looks pretty good, I am just downloading it right now. Leon is addressing a key need with TFS V1, that is to help around managing user permissions in the multiple places necessary and he has somehow managed to create a UI that doesn't make my eyes bleed - in fact it looks very nice!

It is great to see that he is not just addressing the problem of syncing up TFS, Reporting Services and Windows Sharepoint Services permissions - he is also exposing the AreaPath and Source Control permissions in a well presented way that is, no doubt, going to expose more people to the fact that this functionality exists. Hopefully this will allow TFS users to get even more control over their software development process.

Anyway - good work Leon, and thanks for sharing.
