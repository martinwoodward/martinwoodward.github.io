I've been having one of those days today. It's setup day at TechEd Developers and I'm down at the Teamprise Booth. Still not really ready as the pedestal that we've got turned out to be far too big and we're swapping it for a couple of smaller ones. Hopefully everything will be ok for 10.00 tomorrow when the exhibition floor opens to delegates.

The personal highlight of my day was when I plugged in the brand new demo computer, freshly shipped from the states. There was a very loud bang with a nice puff of blue smoke coming from the back of the computer - leading me to see the big notice on the back of it saying "Read instructions before connecting to supply". Turns out that the power supply wasn't auto switching and I should have removed a sticker on the back and switched to 230 VAC. Dope.

There then followed an interesting conversation with a guy at the local PC City in my extremely poor Spanish. Mind you - turning up with a smoking power supply in my hand helped get the message across.

Anyway, power supply works a treat (reminder to self, this one is 230 VAC only so shouldn't be plugged in back in the states without a new power supply being installed)...
