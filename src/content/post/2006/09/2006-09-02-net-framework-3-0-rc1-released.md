I've been involved with Indigo for exactly 2 years this week, through the various changes in product name. Anyway [RC1 of .NET 3.0](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=19E21845-F5E3-4387-95FF-66788825C1AF&displaylang=en) was [released](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=19E21845-F5E3-4387-95FF-66788825C1AF&displaylang=en) yesterday (just [under a year since .NET 2.0](http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/000146.html)). I'm currently downloading it and will install over my beta version of WinFX. I'm quite interested to find out if the .NET Framework assemblies get revved at all or if the framework has the same v2.0.50727 libraries that were released with .NET 2.0 last year + the WinFX stuff. I'll soon find out...

**Update:** Looks like it is .NET 2.0 + WCF, WWF and WPF (which I'm very glad about to be honest). Right then, off to have a play with my TFS Proxy Sync service (which uses WCF to listen to check-in notifications from the Team Foundation Server...)
