If (like me) you are slowly getting hooked on [MSH](http://channel9.msdn.com/wiki/default.aspx/Channel9.MSHWiki) (or [Monad](http://channel9.msdn.com/wiki/default.aspx/Channel9.MSHWiki)), the [James Manning](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmanning/default.aspx)’s latest post will interest you – an early implementation of a [MSH Provider for Team Foundation Server Version Control](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmanning/archive/2006/04/07/570810.aspx) allowing you to access the repository as if it were any other mapped drive. Sweet!
