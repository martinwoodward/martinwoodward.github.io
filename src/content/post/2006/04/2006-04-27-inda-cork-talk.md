Tonight I [spoke at the Cork INDA group](http://www.developers.ie/session.aspx?s=47).  Despite the excellent weather outside loads of people turned up and sat in on a talk on Source Control, which shows true dedication (especially from the folks standing at the back).  I particularly enjoyed it that the audience asked loads of questions that got us off onto interesting tangents.  Thanks again to [Joe](http://developers.ie/blogs/joegill/) for organising everything.

I arrived in Cork city early this morning and it is a very pleasant place to hang out.  If you are a geek in the city then I would recommend sitting in the [Clarion Hotel](http://www.clarioncork.com/) as it is a very pleasant environment to work with free Wifi and they serve an excellent cup of hot tea.  Anyone who knows the Marketing manager for [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com/) will know that he has great taste in hotels and the Clarion is one he would like.  Sadly, when I’m booking hotels myself I tend to go a little more low-budget, but the one I am currently sitting in has plenty of old world charm.  Cork also has a municipal Wifi service – while you have to pay €10 a day to access that, the signal strength is pretty good from the hotel room from which I write this post.

As promised, here is the slide deck as a [zipped Powerpoint file (2196 KB)](http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/SourceControl101WithTFS_CORK.zip)  – also some useful links that were mentioned during questions.

[Microsoft VSTS Virtual Labs](http://www.microsoftvirtuallabs.com/express/registration.aspx?LabId=5ede642a-f4e7-4c3a-8d5b-82d3d7540a19) – connect in to a ready made VSTS environment, you can give the software a try with no need to install anything on your local machine.
