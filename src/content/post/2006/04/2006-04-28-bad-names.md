For [those](http://notgartner.com/posts/4135.aspx) of you [morning](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MourningMonadThisWholeMonadMSHMicrosoftCommandShellPowerShellThingIsTearingMeUpInside.aspx) the loss of Monad as it [henceforth becomes known](http://tomshardware.co.uk/2006/04/25/powershell_windows_command_line_to_ship_q4/) as [Windows PowerShell](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=64772&clcid=0x409) (it’s impossible to say that without putting some inflection into your voice to try and sound like a voice over for a cheesy advert) – we now have a new name to make fun of thanks to Nintendo [renaming there next generation console](http://www.engadget.com/2006/04/27/wii-know-wii-feel-the-same-way/) the Nintendo Wii (and actually pronounced wee).  It’ll no doubt generate more titters than the name of the old [Atari ST operating system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_TOS).

Back to the Microsoft choice of Windows PowerShell.  Seriously – why wasn’t MSH good enough?  A fantastic new object-orientated command line shell does not need a consumer friendly name, in fact a TLA with an “in-the-know” way of pronouncing it is better for geeks – and let’s face it, the new shell ain’t aimed at my Grandma.

It’ll be interesting to see what happens to the popular linux terminal emulator (called [PowerShell](http://powershell.sourceforge.net/)) – hope those guys don’t start feeling the weight of the Redmond lawyers trying to protect a name which a) Was allready being used and b) Isn’t that good anyway.  I know not everyone [likes my companies name](http://blog.dragonsharp.com/?p=52), but a least when you do a [Google for it](http://www.google.com/search?q=teamprise) you get to our website…
