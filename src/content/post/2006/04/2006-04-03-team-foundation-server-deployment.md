[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/tfs_deployment.png)[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/tfs_deployment.png)In some recent forums posts, it has struck me that it is sometimes not clear to people what an install of Microsoft Team Foundation Server looks like. Iâ€™m posting a copy of a (very simple) slide I normally use when explaining this to people in the hope that others will find it useful. If you want this as a powerpoint slide or PDF then feel free to get in touch.
