[](http://indc.wordpress.com/)If you are in or around Dublin next week (May 3rd & 4th 2006), then I would strongly encourage you to come along to the 2006 [Irish National Developers Conference](http://indc.wordpress.com/). This conference is being organised by local .NET development community, and is aimed squarely at the development community. [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) will be speaking as will [other excellent local speakers](http://indc.wordpress.com/speakers/) (I’ll also be tagging along to make the other speakers look good).

The event will also feature the opportunity to try out the technologies being talked about in Hands On Labs using equipment and resources being kindly supplied by the New Horizons training centre.

The [sessions](http://indc.wordpress.com/agenda/) promise to be quite hard-core, much more in-depth than the usual presentation, but there is plenty available to interest most folks. Also, there is plenty of opportunity to talk with other local developers and find out what exciting things are happening in your area.

The speakers will be hanging around the labs at different times in the day so it is your opportunity to get advice, help and tips from them. The event is only €50 to attend, with money going towards the event expenses – all that information for less than the price of a night out!
