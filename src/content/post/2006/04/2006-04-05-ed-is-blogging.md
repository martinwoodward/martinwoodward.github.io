Fellow Teamprise developer [Ed Thomson](http://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/) has started blogging.  As you can tell from the header image in his blog, Ed is our resident Mac lover and his office is festooned with shiney Apple goodies (including one of those fancy new MacIntel machines).  He uses Teamprise on Mac full time for development which has helped us catch numerous places where we didnâ€™t look nice when presented on a Mac OS.
