Recently, I've had a surge of emails asking various questions about Team Foundation Server and how to do certain things.  While I always (eventually) respond, it can sometimes take me a while.  If you have questions about Team Foundation Server then the best place to go is the [MSDN forums](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/default.aspx?ForumGroupID=5&SiteID=1).  These forums are monitored by the VSTS team as well as by the Team System MVP's and other folks who know stuff about the product.  Unlike a lot of newsgroups, these forums are actually a very welcoming and friendly place to ask questions.  I personally hang out on the following forums:-  **[Team Foundation Server - General](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=22&SiteID=1)**  **[Team Foundation Server - Setup](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=68&SiteID=1)**  **[Team Foundation Server - Version Control](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=478&SiteID=1)**  **[Team Foundation Server - Work Item Tracking](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=479&SiteID=1)**  **[Team Foundation Server - Administration](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=477&SiteID=1)**  **[Team Foundation Server - Build Automation](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=481&SiteID=1)**  **[Team Foundation Server - Process Templates](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=482&SiteID=1)**  **[Team Foundation Server - Reporting](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=480&SiteID=1)**  **[Visual Studio Team System - General](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=20&SiteID=1)**  **[Visual Studio Team System - Developers](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=18&SiteID=1)** 

As well as the official [MSDN forums](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/default.aspx?ForumGroupID=5&SiteID=1), you can also try one of the community ones.  These don't tend to get the traffic from Team folks but are still good resources.  It's also a good place to ask questions that you might not want to ask on a Microsoft resource (such as how does TFS stack up against Product B) and get an answer from somebody who is not paid by Microsoft.  [Team System Rocks](http://teamsystemrocks.com/forums/default.aspx) (excellent community resource site)  [TeamFoundationServer.org](http://teamfoundationserver.org/Web/forums/default.aspx) (a new UK based resource) 

At [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com/) we also have our own [forum](http://support.teamprise.com) and [knowledge base](http://kb.teamprise.com) that are worth checking out if the question is related to use of Team Foundation Server from Java or on the Unix / Mac / Linux platforms. 

Before you ask the question, it is probably worth checking the [MSDN documentation](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181232.aspx) first or using your [favorite search engine](http://www.google.com/), but don't worry about asking if you can't find your answer - the folks on these forums are always happy to point you to the best resource. 

You never know, if you ask a question on these forums then you might still get me answering it if you are unlucky enough.  By asking the question in a public forum you are doing a service for the next person that comes down the line with the same problem as they'll be able to see somebody else with the same issue and (hopefully) the answer.
