Poster child of the Web 2.0 movement and all round general legends [Meebo](http://www.meebo.com/) have just launched a new service called [MeeboMe](http://www.meebome.com/) that allows you to host a flash based chat window on your website and allow people to send you IM messages. It is in Alpha stages at the moment so may well cause problems. Anyway – if you want to drop me an IM message then feel free to [click here for a chat window](http://www.woodwardweb.com/chat.html). I’ll not have this on my main page quite yet because a) I’ll probably get tons of spam and b) It’s alpha so will probably break in loads of nasty places. Anyway – worth a try!
