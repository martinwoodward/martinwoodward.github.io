[](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=Highlight4Writer)Well, the benefits of the Live Writer SDK are already coming true for me.  One of my bug-bears with BlogJet was to copy/paste in code samples was pretty tricky.  I ended up evolving a manual process of visiting the excellent [CodeHTMLer](http://puzzleware.net/codeHTMLer/) site to convert into HTML and then pasting the source into BlogJet source view (when pasting Java code I just to tell that CodeHTMLer it was C# and it usually looks great. 

I was over at the CodePlex site this morning and noticed that [Alexander Concha Abarca](http://www.buayacorp.com/) has posted a [Syntax Highlighting Plug-in for LiveWriter](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=Highlight4Writer). 

Seems to work ok so far, the actual plug-in is very simple as it re-uses a [code high-lighting engine](http://www.wilcob.com/Wilco/Toolbox/SyntaxHighlighter.aspx) from [Wilco Bauwer](http://www.wilcob.com/wilco/Default.aspx) which supports many languages including all the ones I may want to talk about such as C#, Java, XML, Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, SQL, Visual Basic, ASP.NET and even Fortran (if I wanted to post my highly fascinating university projects).
