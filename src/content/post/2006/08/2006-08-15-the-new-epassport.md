Soon, we'll be going on holiday for the first time since my son was born.  This means that we had to apply for a passport for my 2 year-old, which was a fun process.  Anyway, the passport arrived this morning and much to my surprise it is a new biometric one, containing a little RFID Chip on the rear of the identification page.  This is the first time that I have seen a new biometric passport.  The notes that come along with it contain the following:-

There is no extra personal information in the machine-readable zone or one the chip.  **The chip and antenna are sensitive electronic devices.  Please protect your passport and the chip from damage.  They must not be bent, torn or damaged in any way, or exposed to very high or very low temperatures, excess moisture, magnetic fields or microwaves.**"

If nobody is making wallets for these new passports, then they should be.  There has to be a market in sturdy tin-foil lined wallets to keep the RFID chip from being broken and to stop the data being read until you want it to be...
