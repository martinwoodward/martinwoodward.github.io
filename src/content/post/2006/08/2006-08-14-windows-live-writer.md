[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsLiveWriter_A58B/live_writer.png) On [Rob's](http://blogs.msdn.com/robcaron) [recommendation](http://blogs.msdn.com/robcaron/archive/2006/08/14/699196.aspx), I've installed [Windows Live Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/) today.  Up until now I've written most of my blog posts in [BlogJet](http://blogjet.com/) - however so far I'm liking Windows Live Writer and may well stick to it.  The thing that I like the most is all the features I use from BlogJet are here (Moveable Type support, image upload, spell checking etc) - but Windows Live Writer also picks up the stylesheets from your blog template and applies them while you are editing - very nice. 

The final (and possibly the deal-clincher for me) is the plug-in model and Live Writer SDK.  I love BlogJet, but there were a few things that I wanted it to do that it didn't.  By providing an SDK it means I'll hopefully be able to get Live Writer to do these things.  By providing a plug-in capability they also increase the chance that I won't have to bother :-) 

While, there has been plenty of comment on this already, [JJ Allaire](http://flyingupsidedown.wordpress.com/) is on the Live Writer team.  Back in the day, I was a huge fan of [Homesite](http://www.adobe.com/products/homesite/) - mainly because it supported the way I created web pages.  You can certainly see the influence in Windows Live Writer - the look and feel is quite similar to [Onfolio](http://www.onfolio.com/). 

There are a couple of things that would make me like Live Writer more.    Fix the bug that seems to want to try and keep connections alive all the time.  I keep getting an error saying the connection has been dropped. Better HTML code editing support.  I know I'm old school - but I like to dip into my HTML occasionally to do something particular.  Though Live Writer has a "HTML Code" view - it is little more that embedded notepad.  It would be nice to have code highlighting and even nicer to have side-by-side editing (ala Dreamweaver).  Even if full side-by-side is not possible just code highlighting and putting you cursor into the correct place when you go into code view would be great.  Auto track-back detection.  Be nice if it would figure out what posts I have linked to and automagically do a trackback.  Most of the time I can't be bothered when I have to figure out the trackback URL manually and paste it in.  Squiggly red underline spell check.  (ala Word - spell check as I type)  In the Image import - allow *.png along with *.gif and *.jpg.   Allow me to easily control where the images were imported to and what they are called. 

But all in all, for an initial beta it is very impressive - especially considering it is free.
