Great news from [Rob Caron](http://blogs.msdn.com/robcaron/).  [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/) has been launched into public beta.   [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/) is an online software development environment for open and shared source developers to create, host and manage projects throughout the project life-cycle. It has been written from the ground up in C# using .NET 2.0 technology with Team Foundation Server on the back end. Think GotDotNet, SourceForge etc but based on top of Team Foundation Server.  I’m pretty sure this site is what Rob was [hinting at](http://blogs.msdn.com/robcaron/archive/2005/10/06/477949.aspx) back in October.  Judging by the folks involved (including the likes of [James Newkirk](http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk/) and [Korby Parnell](http://blogs.msdn.com/korbyp)) you can expect the community around this site to be awesome.

Currently a small number of projects are being added each week while they work out the inevitable teething problems (it is currently marked as version 0.0.0.1504 so let that set your expectations accordingly)  – however it is very exciting news for us TFS fans and already looks mighty impressive for a 0.0 release – good job guys!  You can expect to find me over there as soon as I can get a project approved.
