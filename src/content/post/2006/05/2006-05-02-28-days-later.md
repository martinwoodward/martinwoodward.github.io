[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/28dayslater.png)[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/28dayslater.png)The time had to come.  When I booted up VSTS after the May-Day holiday weekend I got a message warning me that I had 28 days left of my evaluation period.  I had installed the 180–Day Trial Team Suite Edition while my MSDN subscription was transitioned over to the Developer SKU.  Now it looks like it is time for me to un-install VSTS on my client and install the Dev version.  To be honest, in my current project I only really used the other features when demonstrating Team System anyway so it shouldn’t effect anything other than future talks.  But still it is a sad day.  Goodbye Visual Studio 2005 Team Suite, Hello Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Software Developers.
