OK, so the odds that you read my blog and not [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/)’s are pretty low, especially if you have any interest in this topic.  However, [Scott](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) just [announced](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/05/08/445742.aspx) that the [VS 2005 Web Application Project has gone V1.0](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/05/08/445742.aspx).  I had the pleasure of talking with Scott recently and to take a look at this – I have to say that I am incredibly impressed.  It’s like all the goodness of a standard Visual Studio 2005 web project with all of the benefits of the old Visual Studio 2003 way and then some.  For those of you with complicated automated build processes I would definitely go take a look at this way of doing web projects – if you are using Team Build in VSTS then I would definitely use it.  

It’s stuff like this that is blowing me away – just how open Microsoft Developer Division are being at the moment.  I have to say I really like the new way of working, I hope that it is sustainable and they don’t have to retreat to their previous ways of working.  Being a developer right now is a very exciting time.
