[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/CIMG3334.JPG)Back in February Microsoft were [asking for feedback](http://blogs.msdn.com/robcaron/archive/2006/02/17/534416.aspx) on the installation for Team Foundation Server Release Candidate. During the early betas TFS got a lot of flack for being hard to install. The team listened and the install was much more fool-proof by the time it got to RC (most of the trouble was in getting the pre-requisites correctly set up and so the pre-requisite checker was beefed up). Anyway, the sweetener in the deal was the offer of a free t-shirt for the first 300 people to submit the feedback. I’m a sucker for swag so I sent off my form and promptly forgot all about it.

This morning, what should arrive in the mail but my “Team Foundation Server V1 All Stars” t-shirt. Unlike most of the swag I pick up, this one is actually quite nice! Rather sadly, I think I may actually take this along to TechEd with me and get signed by a few of the folks involved. If you are coming along to TechEd and were involved in the development, or you were a fellow beta tester, then be sure to drop by the [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com/) stand for a chat and I’ll embarrass us both by asking you to sign my shirt. Anyway, thanks to the TFS Team and to McKenzie Halgren who appears to have been the unlucky person saddled with the job of mailing all of these out.
