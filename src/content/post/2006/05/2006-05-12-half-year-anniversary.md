This month is my 6th working on [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com/).  I have to say that this has been the best half year of my professional life so far.  Teamprise is a very humbling place to work as a developer.  When you walk down the corridor and bump into the people that helped write the the programs behind the [whole reason you got into computing](http://www.ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html) in the first place it kinda puts a perspective on your own career.  People here know how to make software, and they are unbelievably clever and productive at doing it.  Not only do I work with the best developers, testers and support engineers I have ever met, everyone else in the company is exceptionally good at their jobs.  The bosses understand how to keep the “other stuff” out of your way and let you concentrate on what you are best at.  You get free soda, free popcorn, free pizza on a Wednesday (or the occasional plate of fried food from “[the best take-out restaurant in a former gas station](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=sea+boat+champaign&ll=40.126785,-88.243346&spn=0.019032,0.034633&om=1)”).  You get the chance to participate in some of the [most obscure competitive sports known to man](http://www.ericsink.com/articles/H_O_R_S_E.html). Not only am I proud to work for my company, my company are proud I work for them (as demonstrated by the encouragement to blog about what I do and talk about it to user groups while wearing the company logo).  As my mum would say, I have “landed with my bum in the butter” – this is the most fun I have had in my life, and I get paid to do it.

This blog post is not just about my general level of smugness.  [Teamprise are hiring](http://www.teamprise.com/news/2006/05/now_hiring_software_developer.html) – we are after a very particular [developer](http://www.ericsink.com/No_Programmers.html).  If you think you have what it takes then I urge you to [join us](http://www.teamprise.com/news/2006/05/now_hiring_software_developer.html) on our exciting journey.  [Ed](http://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/) has [posted some great reasons](http://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/2006/05/why_you_should_work_for_teampr.html) why you should come work for [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com/)[ ](http://www.teamprise.com/)if the prospect of free fried food strangely is not enough.
