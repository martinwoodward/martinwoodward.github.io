Just noticed that Google Labs has launched [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends), a nice tool to graph the differences in search volumes over time. Good way of making [comparisons](http://www.google.com/trends?q=google%2C+microsoft%2C+porn&ctab=1&date=all&geo=all) in to what people are looking for information about. Anyone around at the start of podcasting will remember that if you searched in Google for the term “podcast”, it would ask “do you mean broadcast?”. It is interesting to see that the [scales are tipping in the other direction](http://www.google.com/trends?q=podcast%2C+broadcast&ctab=1&date=all&geo=all). Is it also nice to see that [“good” is always more popular than “evil”](http://www.google.com/trends?q=good%2C+evil&ctab=1&date=all&geo=all).
