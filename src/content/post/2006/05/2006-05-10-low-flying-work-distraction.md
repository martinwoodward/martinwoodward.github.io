The weather is fantastic over [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com/) Europe HQ at the moment. For the first time this year I’m sat wearing a short-sleeved shirt with my window open and I am not in the slightest bit cold. Apart from the lovely weather outside my window distracting us, we’ve also had a small plane with some strange aerials hanging off it flying at ridiculously low altitudes. I was wondering if Google Earth was finally going to have some decent overhead images of my area – but the plane was much too low for that. After a brief search of the internet I tracked down the source of the acrobatics – turns out it is the Tellus [project doing a survey of Northern Ireland](http://www.nics.gov.uk/press/eti/050708e-eti.htm). Anyway – nice weather for flying. Can you tell I’ve got some talks coming up? Tomorrow I’ll be in [Limerick](http://www.developers.ie/event.aspx?s=48) and [Gallway](http://www.itag.ie/CalendarofEvents/tabid/83/ctl/View/mid/410/Event/186/Start/200605121900/End/200605122030/Default.aspx) on Friday.
