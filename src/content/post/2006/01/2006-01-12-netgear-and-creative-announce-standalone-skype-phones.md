[](http://tools.netgear.com/skype/)Like buses, you wait for ages then two come along at once.  Following a wave of [Skype](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1724271-10386647) announcements at CES, Creative have [announced](http://www.creative.com/press/releases/welcome.asp?pid=12292) a new [Skype](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1724271-10386647) phone.  Unlike previous offerings, this one does not need a computer to make [Skype](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1724271-10386647) calls but can do it all from the phone with a wired network connection.  Then Netgear came out and trumped that with the [announcement](http://tools.netgear.com/skype/) of a 802.11g WiFi enabled [Skype](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1724271-10386647) phone that looks a lot nicer and can be carried anywhere inside the house, or other WiFi hotspot.  Details on both devices are still sketchy but they should be available Q2 next year.  The Netgear device might be just what I am looking for to get [Skype](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1724271-10386647) past the wife acceptance boundary.
