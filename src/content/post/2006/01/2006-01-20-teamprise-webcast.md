If you've been wondering what I have been up to lately, then make sure you sign up for the following MSDN Webcast:-

[MSDN Webcast: Accessing Visual Studio 2005 Team System Using the Teamprise Plug-In for Eclipse (Level 200).](http://www.microsoft.com/communities/eventdetails.mspx?CMTYSvcSource=MSCOMMedia&Params=%7eCMTYDataSvcParams%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22ID%22+Value%3d%221032289495%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22ProviderID%22+Value%3d%22A6B43178-497C-4225-BA42-DF595171F04C%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22lang%22+Value%3d%22en%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22cr%22+Value%3d%22US%22%2f%5e%7esParams%5e%7e%2fsParams%5e%7e%2fCMTYDataSvcParams%5e)

Find out how you can use the [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com) Plug-in for Eclipse to access the source control features of Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Team System from within the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE). In this webcast, we show you how to add new Eclipse projects to a Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation server, import existing projects from Team Foundation Server into Eclipse, and keep projects synchronized. We also look at the [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com) Explorer client on a Linux virtual machine.

Presenter: Corey Steffen, General Manager, Teamprise (my boss).

Time: 8pm GMT
