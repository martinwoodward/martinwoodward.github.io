At the keynote today at VSLive, [Soma Somasegar](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/default.aspx) publicly [announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2006/01/30/518987.aspx) the availability of VSTS RC in the next week and the RTM in March 2006 - so basically the team are on track.  While that is good news, the highlight of the talk for me was to see Soma (Microsoft's VP of Developer Division) take part in a demo of our Teamprise Explorer client running on a "non-windows client" - Ubuntu 5.10 for those that are interested.  We had loads of people come by the booth today and overall we had a very positive reception.  I was also a little star struck because loads of names that I recognised from [DotNetRocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/) were around, including [Mark Miller](http://www.devexpress.com/) and [Rocky Lhotka](http://lhotka.net/).
