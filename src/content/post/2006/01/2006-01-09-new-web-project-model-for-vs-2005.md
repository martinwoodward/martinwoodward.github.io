Scott Guthrie has posted about a [new web project type](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/12/07/432630.aspx) that will be available for VS 2005. I know quite a few people have been running into difficulties with the [shipped way](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/08/21/423201.aspx) that web projects work in VS 2005 (especially when it comes to automating the build process outside of Visual Studio) and this new model sounds like an interesting hybrid.

While the model is interesting in itself, just wanted to say I also am really enjoying the new found agility, responsiveness and transparency at Microsoft - especially from the DevDiv guys.
