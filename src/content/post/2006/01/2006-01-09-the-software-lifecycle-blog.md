[Via [Rob](http://blogs.msdn.com/robcaron/archive/2006/01/08/510721.aspx)]  Some smart folks over at Avanade have started blogging about the [Software Lifecycle](http://www.sdlcguy.com/blog/default.aspx) (being Avanade, you'd expect this to be heavily focused on VSTS and it is).  If anyone is going to be getting serious about using VSTS "out there" then you'd expect these guys to be bleeding edge.  Anyway, so far the contents looks pretty useful - much better than the drivel you will find at this blog.  Also, I know at least one of the guys is a fan of obscure British television comedy so he deserves respect!
