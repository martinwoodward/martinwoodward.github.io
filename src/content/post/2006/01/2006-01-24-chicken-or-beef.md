If I were clever like [Eric Sink](http://software.ericsink.com/) or [Bill Caputo](http://www.williamcaputo.com/), I'd be able to turn that catchy title in to a witty and insightful post about the software industry. But sadly for you, I'm not and (as witnessed in this blog) my writing skills are pretty awful. My headmaster once wrote in a school report "Martin has invented a whole new way of spelling the English language - sadly I don't think it will catch on".

Instead the phrase "Chicken or Beef" means that I am on my latest round of travels. As I write this message I have bagged 3 of the 8 flights I'm scheduled to be taking in the next 12 days, and I will no-doubt hear those familiar words many more times as I tuck into my microwaved airplane delight with the relish of a condemned man. To be fair the first 3 flights were quite un-eventful, I had a three seats all to myself on the way over the pond and got a nice little snooze, only to be woken by some turbulence. Well, it wasn't strictly the turbulence that woke me, but more the screaming of a women in the row next to mine. A little screaming I can handle, but the praying really started to freak me out so I got back to reading a [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0340682116/woodwardwebcom) (which I read in a single day, and it's been a long time since I made time to read trashy fiction book in a day - it felt wonderfully self indulgent). However, judging by my [employer’s history with air travel](http://software.ericsink.com/entries/teched_07jun2005.html) I’ll still have a look of pleasant surprise if my baggage and I end up at the correct destinations in one piece.

On the positive side, I get to spend a week with the smart folks at [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com) HQ. I am looking forward to spending some time face to face with people I've been telecommuting with for the past few weeks. Also, on Saturday I'll be traveling over to [VS Live](http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/sf/) in San Francisco. If you happen to be around, feel free to pop by the Teamprise stand and take a look at what we've been busy doing for the past few weeks / months. Using Teamprise from Linux or Mac OS X still gives me an excited rush of feeling I'm doing something very naughty that just shouldn't work as well as it does.

Right, I'm off to get some food and then some bad, jet-lag interrupted, sleep. You know, the next time I'm offered, I might go for the beef option. Why not - live life on the edge...
