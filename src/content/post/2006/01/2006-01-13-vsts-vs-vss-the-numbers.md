In my talk at the [Belfast Launch Event](http://www.microsoft.com/ireland/servers/launchtour/), I gave some numbers of the differences that we had found when migrating our source from Visual Source Safe to Team Foundation Server Source Control. Since then I've had a couple of emails asking for them again, so I'm including them in this blog post for posterity.

Note: You might not get the same improvements, this was just my experience on using VSTS across a WAN.
