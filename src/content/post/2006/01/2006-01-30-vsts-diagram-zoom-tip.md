I am in a presentation at the moment and realised that the speakers don't know about this excellent tip that I learnt from [Rob Burke](http://blogs.msdn.com/robburke/) but never seen it written down anywhere.  If you have a scrolling mouse, press Ctrl and scroll the wheel up and down in the VSTS diagrams to zoom in and out - it works really well (even with the scrolling features on most laptop trackpads)
