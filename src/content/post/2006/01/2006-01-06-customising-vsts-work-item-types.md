[Via [Rob](http://blogs.msdn.com/robcaron/)]  Dave McKinstry has recently posted about his [Approach to Process Customization with TFS](http://weblogs.asp.net/dmckinstry/archive/2006/01/03/434440.aspx).  While I have been practising my work item definitions on a scratch project inside a team system VPC before applying them to the production box, he lays out a good process to help you avoid mistakes.

Now if only there was a nice tool that followed this workflow but did all the global search / replaces for you.  Another project for the back-burner me thinks.
