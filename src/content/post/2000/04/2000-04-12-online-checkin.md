Member of the team who produced the pioneering online check-in site for BA.   Full J2EE n-tier application, however the best bit is the "little man" interface where you can click on a seat to select which seat you want and the little man moves.  A shortcut feature is that you can actually type the number in an it moves the little man.  This style of interface has been much re-used on other systems since it was done.
