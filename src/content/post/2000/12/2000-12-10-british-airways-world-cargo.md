The site was a full J2EE based eBusiness platform for BA World Cargo. It introduced track and trace functionality, which involves communicating with a legacy mainframe system. I am particulary proud of the [barcode generation jsp pages](http://www.baworldcargo.com/barcode/index.jsp) which I wrote in the back of a car while on my way across Scotland to catch a ferry.
