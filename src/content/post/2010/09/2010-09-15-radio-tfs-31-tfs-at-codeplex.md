In the [latest episode of Radio TFS](http://www.radiotfs.com/2010/09/14/TFSAtCodePlex.aspx) Mickey and I sat down for a chat with Jonathan Wanagel who is the Principal Development Manager over at [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/), Microsoft's open source project hosting site. We talk about what CodePlex is, how it uses Team Foundation Server under the hood, their recent upgrade from TFS 2008 to TFS 2010 and cover some of the agile practises that the CodePlex team uses to push out a new release of the site every three weeks.

Visit the [Radio TFS site to listen in](http://www.radiotfs.com/2010/09/14/TFSAtCodePlex.aspx), and while you are there don’t forget to subscribe to the [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/radiotfs) or subscribe in [Zune](zune://subscribe/?Radio%20TFS=http://feeds.feedburner.com/radiotfs) or [iTunes](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=274094361) to pick up more great shows now that we’re back to our old show schedule.
