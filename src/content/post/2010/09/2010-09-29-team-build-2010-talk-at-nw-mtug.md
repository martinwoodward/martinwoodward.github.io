Tonight I’ll be giving a talk on Team Foundation Build for NW-MTUG at the University of Ulster’s Magee Campus.  The event starts at 6.30pm – if you are around it would be great to see you there.  I’ll be giving away [a copy of my book](http://amzn.to/bXPvaz) to one lucky person prepared to sit through the whole talk :-)  

**Session Summary:**  

In this session Martin takes us on a tour of the build automation features provided by Team Foundation Server 2010.  First we will discuss the basics of build automation and why it is the second most important thing you can do to improve software quality in your organization.  Then we will highlight the new features in the 2010 release and how to use them to automate the building of your applications.  Finally we will do a deep dive into customizing the build process and discuss the build experience against Team Foundation Server 2010 from Visual Studio 2008 and earlier.  

**Location: **MS Block, University of Ulster’s Magee Campus at 6.30pm.
