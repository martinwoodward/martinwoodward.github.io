\*\*\*\*A couple of weeks ago I was in Antwerp for a partner event and I also had the pleasure of meeting with a few customers from the Belgium and Luxembourg region. One of the customers I spoke with was Network Research Belgium (NRB) who were doing some very interesting work and using Team Foundation Server 2010 for their heterogeneous development efforts.

Tom Mertens has [published information on a Case Study](http://blogs.technet.com/b/belpta/archive/2010/12/02/nrb-reduces-development-costs-by-10-with-team-foundation-server-2010.aspx) just completed with them where they show how they have reduced the development costs by 10% using Team Foundation Server to develop software for .NET, Java, Cobol and PL/1. For more information and for the English, French or Dutch versions of the case study see: [NRB reduces development costs by 10% with Team Foundation Server 2010](http://blogs.technet.com/b/belpta/archive/2010/12/02/nrb-reduces-development-costs-by-10-with-team-foundation-server-2010.aspx) [NRB réduit ses frais de développement de 10% grâce au Team Foundation Server 2010 ](http://www.microsoft.com/belux/fr/cases/?case=nrb) [NRB vermindert ontwikkelkosten met tien procent dankzij Team Foundation Server 2010 ](http://www.microsoft.com/belux/nl/cases/?case=nrb)
