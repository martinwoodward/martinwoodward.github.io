[](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=615)On Monday I was a little under the weather suffering from the winter tummy bug that is floating around at the moment, but my day was cheered up by a phone call from Carl and Richard over at [.NET Rocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/).  We had a catch-up chat as to what has been happening in the past year since starting work at Microsoft, talked about Team Explorer Everywhere and TFS in general.  Blame the fact that I hadn’t eaten for two days, but we jumped around a lot and covered a whole different bunch of stuff about Team Foundation Server and ALM in general.

Anyway, it’s always fun talking with the guys but hopefully it turned out to be an interesting enough podcast.  Let me know what you think!
