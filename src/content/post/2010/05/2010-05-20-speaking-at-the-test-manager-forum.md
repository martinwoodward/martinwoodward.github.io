On Thursday 20th May, I have the privilege of speaking at the [Test Manager Forum in Dublin](http://www.sqs-ire.com/testmanagerforum_dublin2010.php).  I’ll update this post after the event with links to the slides, other resources and any other links that might come up that I end up promising to share to the audience.  

Also, I just wanted to say a big Thanks to [Brian Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/) who’s [content I’m stealing for my session](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/archive/2010/05/05/visual-studio-2010-alm-presentations-from-my-recent-roadshow.aspx).  If you haven’t already – be sure to check out the [free sample chapter on Manual Testing](http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/68/04704842/0470484268-2.pdf) from the [Professional Application Lifecycle Management with Visual Studio 2010 book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0470484268?ie=UTF8&tag=woodwardwebcom&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0470484268) that Brian and I helped co-author.  Brian’s manual testing chapter was essential reading for me when I was learning the tools.  

Anyway, wish me luck!
