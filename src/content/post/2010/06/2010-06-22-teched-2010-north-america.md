I had the pleasure of travelling to New Orleans for the first time to speak at TechEd 2010 North America.  New Orleans is now my favourite city to go to for a big conference like this.  While there were plenty of hotels that you could walk to (if you can stand the humidity), there was also plenty of things to see and do.  

For [my session I got to talk about Team Explorer Everywhere](http://www.msteched.com/2010/NorthAmerica/DEV308) which was a lot of fun.  For the first time, TechEd sessions are now available to everyone even if you didn’t attend the conference so you can find my session below.  You can even download the [slide deck](http://ecn.channel9.msdn.com/o9/te/NorthAmerica/2010/pptx/DEV308.pptx) or a version to watch on your [iPhone /iPod](http://ecn.channel9.msdn.com/o9/te/NorthAmerica/2010/mp4/DEV308.mp4) (it was a cross-platform talk after all :-) )

In addition to my own talk, I picked out the following sessions are available that might be of interest in the TFS / VS Ultimate space.  All of these are available to watch online or download and watch while on the move.  Let me know if I missed one of your favorites:     [KeyNote Day 1: Bob Moglia in New Orelans for TechEd 2010](http://www.msteched.com/2010/NorthAmerica/Keynote01)
