Since joining Microsoft it has been fantastic to see how committed everyone is to the technology that was acquired from Teamprise. When Microsoft purchased the Teamprise technology, they also hired all the developers (including me) and are investing heavily not just in the 2010 release but more importantly the long-term future of heterogeneous development using Team Foundation Server. Since joining Microsoft weâ€™ve grown the team with some fantastic developers (both Software Development Engineers and Software Development Engineers in Test) who we poached from others parts of the company.

We are now after one more person to join our little family. We need someone to help us with our User Education work. If you know of a technical writer that might be interested in working with us then please send them over to this [job posting](https://careers.microsoft.com/JobDetails.aspx?ss=&pg=0&so=&rw=2&jid=10007&jlang=EN) at Microsoft Careers ([https://careers.microsoft.com/JobDetails.aspx?ss=&pg=0&so=&rw=2&jid=10007&jlang=EN](https://careers.microsoft.com/JobDetails.aspx?ss=&pg=0&so=&rw=2&jid=10007&jlang=EN)). This role is based in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA

I promise you, it is a very exciting time to be joining our team. I am looking forward to showing you a bit more of what we have been working on soon!
