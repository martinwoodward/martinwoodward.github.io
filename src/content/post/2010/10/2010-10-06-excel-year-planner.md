[](http://cid-c7a08ae2600d197a.office.live.com/self.aspx/Public/YearPlanner)As [I’ve mentioned in the past](http://www.woodwardweb.com/dotnet/the_year_planne.html), I like to have a compact year planner on the wall next to my desk so that I can quickly reference stuff.  What day of the week a date would be, when I’m supposed to be on vacation, when the major conferences are and product milestones etc.  

The various templates for year planners I had in Office 2010 were not quite what I like, and I couldn’t find a simple year planner for 2011 around online so I knocked up a quick spreadsheet that will generate a year planner for me.  Simply rename a sheet to a different year and the sheet will change to be the year planner for that year.  The whole thing is formula based using conditional formatting, no macros etc.  

Thought I’d post it to my blog as others might find this useful along with the year planners generated by my spreadsheet for 2010, 2011 and 2012.  Note that there is some funky date/time math in these sheets so they come with the “works on my machine” guarantee – results when printing outside of the UK might vary…     [YearPlanner.xlsx](http://cid-c7a08ae2600d197a.office.live.com/view.aspx/Public/YearPlanner/YearPlanner.xlsx)    [YearPlanner_2010.pdf](http://cid-c7a08ae2600d197a.office.live.com/self.aspx/Public/YearPlanner/YearPlanner^_2010.pdf)    [YearPlanner_2011.pdf](http://cid-c7a08ae2600d197a.office.live.com/self.aspx/Public/YearPlanner/YearPlanner^_2011.pdf)    [YearPlanner_2012.pdf](http://cid-c7a08ae2600d197a.office.live.com/self.aspx/Public/YearPlanner/YearPlanner^_2012.pdf)   

Let me know if you find them useful.
