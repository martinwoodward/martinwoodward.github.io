There are a bunch of really cool Raspberry Pi based clusters out there such as:

- [5 years of Raspberry Pi Clusters](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/five-years-of-raspberry-pi-clusters/) - From the Official Raspberry Pi blog
- [Jeff Geerling's Blog](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/) - lots of tips on building RPi based clusters
- [Turing Pi](https://turingpi.com/) - RPi cluster in a Mini-ITX sized mount that takes care of network and power.
- [Worlds Largest RPi Cluster](https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/building-the-world%e2%80%99s-largest-raspberry-pi-cluster) - Current record belongs to Oracle. See them bulding their cluster [here](https://youtu.be/KbVcRQQ9PNw)

## Hardware

[This is mine](https://twitter.com/martinwoodward/status/1296532700149489664). As a few people have asked about it, here is a component list:

- 7 x Raspberry Pi 4 B (4GB) [🇬🇧](https://amzn.to/2FACjwD) [🇺🇸](https://amzn.to/34mCtlS)
- 7 x GeeekPi Raspberry Pi 4 PoE HAT [🇬🇧](https://amzn.to/31ezTMy) [🇺🇸](https://amzn.to/3l5r0wG)
- 7 x MicroSD Card [🇬🇧](https://amzn.to/31hpPCH) [🇺🇸](https://amzn.to/3hi1hir)
- 7 x 0.25m or 1ft CAT6 patch cables [🇬🇧](https://amzn.to/3l4o8QM) [🇺🇸](https://amzn.to/3aM959J)
- 4 x The Pi Hut CLuster Case for Raspberry Pi (with Fans) [🇬🇧](https://thepihut.com/products/cluster-case-for-raspberry-pi) [🇺🇸](https://thepihut.com/products/cluster-case-for-raspberry-pi)
- NETGEAR 8-Port Gigabit Ethernet PoE Network Switch (GS108PP) - Hub with 8 x PoE+ @ 123W [🇬🇧](https://amzn.to/3aLYlrU) [🇺🇸](https://amzn.to/34kx1j7)
- Pack of spare M3 spacers & standoffs [🇬🇧](https://amzn.to/2QfWSkd) [🇺🇸](https://amzn.to/326hh0o)
- Aluminimum Plate 1mm or 0.050" thick 100mm x 340mmm. I got a bit of aluminium from a local hardware store designed to be used as a protective door plate

All that said - just seen [this case](https://amzn.to/32jpzT4) and very tempted as it should be substantially quieter also if you leave the fans off the PoE HAT and just go with the big fans on this enclosure. Alternatively [this one](https://amzn.to/2QaB2yB) looks handy too and has room for a router.

## Coming Up Next

Currently looking at adding three panels of 8x8 RGB's to one face in a custom 3d printed mount so that I can show blue-green deployments happening inside the cluster. Components on the way to accomplish this:

- 3 x 64 LED Matrix Panel WS2812B [🇬🇧](https://amzn.to/3aJaD4e) [🇺🇸](https://amzn.to/3iYmEWv)
- Adafruit Fade Candy [🇬🇧](https://amzn.to/3j2UycB) [🇺🇸](https://amzn.to/3hk3REr)
- 48v to 5v step down convertor [🇬🇧](https://amzn.to/32fkkUa) [🇺🇸](https://amzn.to/3jeoeUr)
- DC Jack and Socket [🇬🇧](https://amzn.to/2YoQQlA) [🇺🇸](https://amzn.to/3aHZmkP)
- Acrylic Diffuser

I'll update if I get that done or if it turns out not very effective.
