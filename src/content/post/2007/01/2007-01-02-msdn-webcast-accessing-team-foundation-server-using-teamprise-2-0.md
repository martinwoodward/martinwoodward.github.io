On Tuesday January 9th, I'll be doing a short MSDN webcast to demonstrate Teamprise 2.0 in action. If you haven't yet seen a demo of Teamprise or have some questions that you've been wanting answered then please [sign up](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032320652&Culture=en-US). I'll be concentrating on our Eclipse plug-in but I will also show a little of Teamprise Explorer 2.0 and the command line tools.

**[MSDN Webcast: Accessing Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server Using the Teamprise Plug-in for Eclipse (Level 200)](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032320652&Culture=en-US)\*\***
Duration:** 60 minutes
**Start:\*\* Tuesday, January 09, 2007 9:00 AM Pacific Time (5pm GMT, [Additional Timezones](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=9&month=1&year=2007&hour=9&min=0&sec=0&p1=234))

If you can't make this time then the event will be recorded and I'll post details of the recording as soon as I have them.

**Update:** The link above will now take you to the recording which should stay up for a couple of years or so.
