I'm getting really excited about the next CTP for the next release of Visual Studio (Codenamed Orcas).  Not only will previews of some great new features in Team Foundation Server be [coming along](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2007/01/11/january-visual-studio-orcas-ctp-available.aspx), [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) [just announced](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/01/22/visual-studio-orcas-web-designer-integrated-into-main.aspx) a bunch of changes to the web designer editor in Visual Studio.  Reading [Scotts post](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/01/22/visual-studio-orcas-web-designer-integrated-into-main.aspx) it looks like the Visual Studio editor has now got nearly all the features you would want, including ones I was used to from static page and JSP development using Dreamweaver.  Orcas is shaping up to be a very exciting release!
