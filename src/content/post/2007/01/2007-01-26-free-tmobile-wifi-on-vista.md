Over the next few months I'm going to be doing a bit of traveling to the US again, and [this offer](http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2007/01/24/exclusive-to-windows-vista-users-complimentary-t-mobile-hotspot-access.aspx) could not have come at a better time - [free TMobile access from my Windows Vista Laptop](http://www.skysurprise.com/) - sweet!  I'll post back when I have been through the sign-up process to see what validation it does of your Vista running status, I hope for their sakes that it is a little more than a [User-Agent](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/59/) check...

**Update:**  Sadly for them, they are simply doing a user-agent check.  This offer may run out pretty quickly so sign up now if you can...
