This is a follow-up to a [post](http://www.woodwardweb.com/personal/000171.html) I made [over a year ago](http://www.woodwardweb.com/personal/000171.html). I'm popping over to the US for a couple of days this week and I am currently sat in Newark airport with the New York skyline out one window, and Ikea out the other. Since making that post, I must have been back to the US 7 or 8 times and flown on a few dozen flights with several different carriers. On the flight over this morning, I finally broke with form and actually went for the beef option. Crazy times :-)

While failing to get to sleep on the way over, I also listened to the [Hitchhikers Guide to the Future](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hhgttf/) series for the first times in a couple of years. Considering this was broadcast in 2001, it amazing how much of this stuff has appeared as part of the Web 2.0 bubble - and how much of it is still yet to appear. Anyway, even if you are not a fan of the (much missed) Douglas Adams, I encourage you to take a [listen](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hhgttf/).

Right then, I promise that this is the last post I'll make on such an inane topic. If I had a cat, I'd include some pictures of it just to get that out of my system.
