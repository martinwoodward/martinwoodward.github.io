Those of you lucky enough to have an MSDN subscription can go download Beta 1 very shortly, according to the [announcement](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx) it is available now (but it isn't showing up in my MSDN subscription yet) - I suspect that the lovely bits on on the way through the MSDN distribution pipe as we speak. 

However, while you are waiting you can check out the C[hannel 9 video of the announcement from Soma](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=302229#302229). 

My poor ADSL pipe - I'm already downloading [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) Linux 7.04 over bittorrent which was also released today.  At least I'll have something to play with over the weekend :-) 

With Beta 1 I'm going to be attempting a side by side installation of Orcas Beta 1 with VS 2005 and VS 2003 (and also the many versions of Eclipse I have on my main dev machine which is running Vista).  I'll let you know how I get on.  I will however be cheating and going for the VPC version of Team Foundation Server just to save myself some time setting that up right now.

Update:  The VPC Image with Team Foundation Server installed is now available via the public download site.  Personally, I use a download manager (such as wxDownload) to get these files as they are pretty big.  If you do to, then the following direct download links may well be useful
