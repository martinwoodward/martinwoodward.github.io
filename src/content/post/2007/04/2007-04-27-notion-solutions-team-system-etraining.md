[Mickey Gousset](http://teamsystemrocks.com/blogs/mickey_gousset/) has [posted details](http://teamsystemrocks.com/blogs/mickey_gousset/archive/2007/04/27/1611.aspx) of the new [Team System training courses](http://www.notionsolutions.com/Training/eTraining/eTrainingdescription/tabid/92/Default.aspx) from [Notion Solutions](http://www.notionsolutions.com/). What I think is very excited about this offering is that it is a proper "remote learning" initiative. It has all the self-paced benefits of computer based training initiatives, but the critical difference is the involvement of Mickey himself as a tutor available over live meeting when you need him.

Not only do you get to learn Team System from one of the best Team System training companies on the planet, you also get to learn it directly from one of the authors of the [best Team Foundation Server book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FProfessional-Foundation-Server-Jean-Luc-David%2Fdp%2F0471919306%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1177700499%26sr%3D8-1&tag=woodwardwebcom&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738) and someone who has depth and real-life experience of the product. That's a cool offering, I hope it works out well.
