[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/images/admin_shell.ico) In Windows Vista, one of the first things I do on a new machine is create an "Admin Shell".  The steps I do are as follows:-  Copy the shortcut of your favorite command prompt ([PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx) or cmd.exe) Rename the shortcut "Admin Shell" or whatever you want.  I use "Admin Shell" and then eventually the Windows, "Admin" keyboard shortcut works for it when I have use the computer long enough. Edit the shortcut properties.  (Right click, Properties).  In Shortcut, Advanced... check the "run as administrator" option. Then set the Colors, Screen background to be something that will let you know that this command prompt is running as administrator - I use 51,0,0 as the RGB value to give the shell a nice but slight scary red tinge. 

The only thing that was missing was an icon to make this stand out more as my admin shell.  Here is a [red version of the PowerShell icon](http://www.woodwardweb.com/images/admin_shell.ico) that I just hacked together - enjoy (Right click, save as...)
