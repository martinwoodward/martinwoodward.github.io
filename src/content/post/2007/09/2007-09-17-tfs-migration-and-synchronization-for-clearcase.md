[Brian Harry](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/) has posted some great news over on his blog - [Microsoft have release a new tool to allow users to migrate from ClearCase to Visual Studio Team Foundation Server](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2007/09/14/tfs-migration-synchronization-tool-for-clearcase-relased.aspx). From Brian's blog:-

A quick summary of the features of the tool:

Supports migration of base ClearCase VOBs

Migrate a snapshot of source control to TFS

Migrate files to Team Foundation Server while preserving history

Migrate branches to Team Foundation Server retaining the branching structure/hierarchy

Bidirectional synchronization of data between TFS and ClearCase

Hopefully this will really help people as they move from ClearCase or even people who would like to try TFS in a small isolated team but still synchronize back to the main enterprise ClearCase repository. Keep an eye on [Matt Mitrik's TFS Migration Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/tfs_migration/) for more details.
