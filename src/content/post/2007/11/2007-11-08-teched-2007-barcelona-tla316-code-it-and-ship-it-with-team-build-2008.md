Thanks to everyone who came along to the talk today in Barcelona.  We had a big crowd who seemed to enjoy the session.  I had a few people coming up afterwards asking for a copy of the Wallboard code that we built during the session - I'm currently in the process of adding some extra comments to the code to explain some of the bits I skipped over quickly in the talk and I'll post it here shortly as well as uploading to the TechEd site - keep an eye on this post for more details.
