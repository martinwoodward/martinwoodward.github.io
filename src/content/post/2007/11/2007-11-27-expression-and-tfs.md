Recently I've been playing more and more with the [Expression](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/) suite of tools.  I especially enjoy playing with [Blend 2](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/features.aspx?key=blend2preview) and pretending that I can draw. 

While the integration with Visual Studio 2008 is very good, a big thing that is missing for me is that there is no integration with TFS.  If you would also like TFS integration in the Expression products then be sure to vote on the following feature request in Connect:- 

[https://connect.microsoft.com/Expression/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=294157](https://connect.microsoft.com/Expression/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=294157) 

For those of you that don't know [Connect](http://connect.microsoft.com/), it is the system that Microsoft use to accept bugs and feedback for their products.  It can be a little hard to find your way around in Connect, but once you have figured it out it is worth adding your bugs and feedback.  The data actually gets synchronized with their TFS work item repository so data you enter shows up in the IDE of the developer working on the feature and the reports of the managers responsible. 

I have been very pleasantly surprised with the quality of feedback and the responsiveness to all the issues that I have raised on connect during the Visual Studio 2008 beta cycle - the team's responses have been very honest and transparent with their delivery process which I personally think is a great way to interact with your community.  This is especially true if your community is like the Visual Studio one and made up of smart developers that also understand software development.
