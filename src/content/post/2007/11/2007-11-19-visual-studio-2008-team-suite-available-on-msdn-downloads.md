I got an IM message from fellow Team System MVP [Grant Holliday](http://ozgrant.com/) this morning prompting me to log-in to [MSDN Subscription Downloads](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/vstudio/aa718656.aspx) and see what was new - lo and behold I'm downloading VSTS 2008 as we speak ;-)

I am currently getting above 220 Kb/sec download which is close to the maximum I ever get on my DSL line so they are obviously doing something special with the 2008 release to get it in everyone's hands as quick as possible.

The betas of VSTS 2008 have proved to be very solid and I am looking forward to taking the released version for a spin. I'm actually doing [a talk at my local user group (NIMTUG) tonight](http://nimtug.org/events/45/default.aspx) and I'm sorely tempted to see if I can give them an exclusive first look ;-)

Congratulations to the team at Microsoft!
