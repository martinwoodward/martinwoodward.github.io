The Team System group are holding a couple of their popular group chats again on Wednesday, December 5th.  If you haven't been to one before it is a great opportunity to get to talk live with the very people that work on team system, give them your feedback and get your questions answered direct by the folks that made it.  I'm expecting lots of discussion around the recent 2008 release, upgrade questions and licensing etc. 

**Come chat with the Visual Studio Team System group â€“ December 5th** 

Join members of the Visual Studio Team System product group to discuss features available in Team Foundation Server, Team Suite, Architecture Edition, Development Edition, Database Edition, and Test Edition. In addition, discuss what's new for these editions for Visual Studio 2008.
