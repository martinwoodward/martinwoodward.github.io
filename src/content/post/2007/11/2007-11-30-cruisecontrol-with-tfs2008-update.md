Just a quick update on the TFS2008 with [CruiseControl](http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/) (java version) [issue](http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=312511). I recently [submitted the patch](http://jira.public.thoughtworks.org/browse/CC-735) to the CruiseControl project and it has already kindly been commited into trunk by Dan Rollo. The patch should appear in the 2.7.2 release of CruiseControl. If you need it before then you can download the [latest sources from the CruiseControl project](http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/svn.html).
