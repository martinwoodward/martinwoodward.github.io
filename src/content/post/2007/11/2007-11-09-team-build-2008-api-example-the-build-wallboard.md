As [promised](http://www.woodwardweb.com/000394.html), here is the code we created during the [TFS 2008 Build session at TechEd 2007 in Barcelona](http://www.woodwardweb.com/personal/000391.html).

The idea was that this is "Wallboard" that is designed to run on a machine in a public area of the office. It publishes the current state of the build system so everyone can see it (and know who to blame when it goes wrong). If you wanted you could also extend this example to give additional information such as details of recent check-ins, recently raised/resolved work items etc - a good way to teach yourself the TFS managed API.

For a sped up example of how this works - see this [screencast](http://people.teamprise.com/~martin/Wallboard/Wallboard.html). The source code is available here ([BuildWallboard.zip, 268 KB](http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/BuildWallboard.zip))
