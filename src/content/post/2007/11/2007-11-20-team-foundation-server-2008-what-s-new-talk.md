[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/talks/TFS2008_Whats_New.pdf) Last night I had the pleasure of [presenting](http://nimtug.org/events/45/default.aspx) to my local .NET User Group ([NIMTUG](http://nimtug.org/default.aspx)) on what is new in Team Foundation Server 2008.  Interestingly, most of the audience where new to TFS completely so I also covered a bit of ground on what Team Foundation Server did and why - however most of the talk concentrated on the Team Build stuff new in TFS 2008 and I ran through the wallboard demo that I wrote for TechEd. 

In you are interested, the slides are here:-  [Powerpoint 2007 format (zipped) - 2.80 MB](http://www.woodwardweb.com/talks/TFS2008_Whats_New.zip)  [PDF - 3.25 MB](http://www.woodwardweb.com/talks/TFS2008_Whats_New.pdf) 

and the demo code is available [here](http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/000395.html). 

Thanks to everyone that turned out for the talk - it was very well attended despite the weather.  During the session, I offered a couple of drinks to anyone who would be photographed with a Team System temporary tattoo on their head, sadly no-one took me up on the offer ;-)
