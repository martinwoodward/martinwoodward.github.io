As I've [mentioned before](http://www.woodwardweb.com/dotnet/000120.html), I love [Resharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/index.html) from those crazily clever folks at [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/).  Today I installed an [Early Access version of 3.0.2](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/Download) into Visual Studio 2008 and all the goodness has returned.  No need to write a Using statement again, error highlighting in C# without needing a build, the good old Ctrl-Shift-N keyboard shortcut among others.  The 3.0.2 release has come a long way since the 2.5 release that I had been previously using, there are increased coding best practises and some nicer inline static anaylsis.  The plug-in is also much more friendly in how it takes over any Visual Studio shortcuts and means that I don't have to re-train the old muscle memory when switching between keyboard shortcuts for actions in Eclipse and Visual Studio. 

If you are spending all your day in Visual Studio then I urge you to take a look at [Resharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/index.html).  Personally, I find the increase in productivity well worth it, not to mention the increase in code quality that you get as a result.
