As I've mentioned before - keyword expansion is a feature that many SCM tools have, but TFS does not.  [Buck Hodges](http://blogs.msdn.com/buckh/) has just published an [excellent post](http://blogs.msdn.com/buckh/archive/2007/07/07/keyword-expansion-in-tfs.aspx) on why this is the case and talks about some of the approaches that people have tried to get around this.  Definitely worth a read.
