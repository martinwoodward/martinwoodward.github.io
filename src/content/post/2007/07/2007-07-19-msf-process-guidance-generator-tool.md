A [new project has been released over on CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/process/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=5626) from the Patterns and Practices folks which attempts to improve the guidance generation process.

"The interim solution makes it easier to customise the narrative guidance than the current mechanisms, but I should emphasize that it will be replaced by our longer term solution. Please use it in the meantime if you'd like to, but don't place any reliance on it being there long term."

I've just taken a quick look at the [tool](http://www.codeplex.com/process/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=5626). While it is faster than MSFWinBuild it is still quite rough around the edges and you are still left editing the guidance XML file (which for Agile is a single file with over 10,000 lines...).

Any software processs should evolve as you change it to meet the stengths and weeknesses in your organization. As those stengths and weekness change, but also as new tools, techniques and technologies are made available, so your process will need some tweaking. With the current tooling, many teams let their process guidance pages get out of date with their actual process usage - which is a very bad thing (especially when a new member of the team joins or worse, the external auditor comes to inspect your team).

It is a very welcome development that work is going on in this area. I cannot wait to see that "longer term solution" when it arrives, in the meantime I'll be using the [process generator tool](http://www.codeplex.com/process/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx).
