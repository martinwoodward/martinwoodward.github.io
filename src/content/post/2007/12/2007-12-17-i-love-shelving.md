No - this is not a post about the [big news in Northern Ireland this past week](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3047534.ece).  On Friday night I was in the middle of a rather large change that I wasn't ready to check-in to the mainline of code.  However, as I am now in the habit of doing, I shelved the changes to TFS before I stopped work for the evening.  Shelving is a neat feature in Team Foundation Server.  It lets you save your files onto the server without committing the change into the mainline of code. 

Over the weekend, my main development machine decided to die on me pretty badly.  It wouldn't even get as far as the BIOS screen - despite plenty of power getting to the motherboard.  An hour long conversation with the friendly technician resulting if nothing more than my knees getting a little dusty and so the machine is now in a box on the way back to the manufacturer.  However, I was able to un-shelve the changes from Friday night onto my laptop and carry on working were I left off with no code loss. 

Needless to say - this morning I became a *very* big fan of shelving:-)
