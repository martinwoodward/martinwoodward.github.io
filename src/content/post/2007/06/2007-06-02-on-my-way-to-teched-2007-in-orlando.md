I am currently sat in sunny Newark having sped through immigration in record time (there wasn't a single person in front of me in the queue - the first time that has ever happened. For anyone that it interested, I've fallen back into my [Chicken rut](http://www.woodwardweb.com/personal/000171.html).

Anyway, I'm on my way to [TechEd in Orlando](http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2007/community.mspx). This year I'll be working at the Team System [TLC](http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2007/learningcenter.mspx) (Technical Learning Center) as well as hanging around the Teamprise booth (#1333 near the massage area apparently) - do pop by and say "Hi" if you are around or at any of the various parties etc.

**Update:** Woot! I've just had an email telling me that I've been bumped to First for my Newark to Orlando segment. Sweet.
