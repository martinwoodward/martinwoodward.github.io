Last night I had the privilege of being invited to a party hosted by the good folks running the Visual Studio Industry Partner program that Teamprise is a member of. The venue was the perfect place to host a party for nerds - they hired out the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Center. I have wanted to visit the space center since I was a child so this was a great moment for me. They even allowed us in to the IMAX theater to watch the [Space Station movie](http://www.imax.com/spacestation/) in 3D, and all the soda and popcorn was also included - fantastic. As well as looking at rockets, there is a nice little museum attached to the conference center. Thanks to everyone at VSIP for organizing the event - especially Laura and Joe. I've posted a [set of the photos](http://www.flickr.com/gp/58045305@N00/89Lo03) if you are interested.
