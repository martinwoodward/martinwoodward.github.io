Good news [World's Smallest TFS Proxy fans](http://www.woodwardweb.com/personal/000358.html#comments).  At 11:10 this morning, the friendly man from Dell appeared at my door with a new motherboard flown in from Holland this morning.  With-in twenty minutes he had the motherboards swapped out and we plugged the SX270 in to hear that familiar whirr of the fans as it came back to life. 

Now, I know that Dell customer support has been getting a lot of stick lately - but I have to say that I've been left seriously impressed.  Exactly 24-hours after reporting a problem with an old, out of warranty, machine I'd bought from their Dell Outlet store (which sells returned machines at a discount), I had a brand new motherboard and was back up an running.  Can't ask for more than that. 

More importantly, the World's Smallest TFS Proxy Server lives again, hopefully to put in a few more years tireless service in my garage.
