[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/AllYourDisksAreBelongToUs_9643/Win_vista_men%5B3%5D.gif) With the Trustworthy Computing initiative, we'd all thought the days of [easter eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(virtual)) in [Microsoft products](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_eggs_in_Microsoft_products) had died, however three enterprising young men from the Anti-piracy Team at Microsoft managed to get themselves included as part of the security hologram on the front of every copy of the Windows Vista media.  If you have a copy of Vista handy, take a close look at the [color windows logos](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/howtotell/en/popup.aspx?subFolder=en&featureTypeFolder=antiPiracyFeatureParts&xml=apFeaturePart68&horizontal=yes), in the outermost circles you will see two large rectangles with two small rectangles either side (about 1mm high).  If you zoom into these rectangles you'll either get a public domain picture of an old master, or the picture above of the folks that designed the hologram.  Good work fellas!  For more information, see the [Windows Vista blog,](http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2007/06/13/the-devil-is-in-the-details.aspx) the [site of the guy who noticed this picture](http://inicia.es/de/kwisatz/index.html#2878790462939498204) or the [Engadget post](http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/13/microsoft-embedding-nerdy-photo-in-vista-dvds/) about the story.
