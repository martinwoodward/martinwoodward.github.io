[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/STS117Launch_856A/shuttle_trail%5B10%5D.jpg) At 4pm the floor of TechEd 2007 closed and I headed straight off to Cocoa Beach to find a spot to watch the Shuttle launch.  It was great driving along the roads, past all the people parked up on the side of the road. Obviously the traffic was pretty bad, but better than I expected.  We arrived just after 7pm and found a perfect spot on the beach in fantastic weather.  The sight and sounds of the actual launch were incredible, especially the belly rumbling thunder of the sonic boom and the cheers of joy from all the people massed onto the beach.  The most unexpected thing was the cloud left by the launch trail - a truly beautiful sight.
