Some interesting news seems to be coming out of the [Alt.NET Conference in Austin](http://www.altnetconf.com/).  I'd got a few IM's from folks at the conference talking about Scott Guthrie's talk. According to [Jeff Palermo](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/default.aspx)'s blog, [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) [showed off a new ASP.NET MVC Framework](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/10/05/altnetconf-scott-guthrie-announces-asp-net-mvc-framework-at-alt-net-conf.aspx).  This looks very interesting and might well tempt me back into ASP.NET development.  I really like parts of ASP.NET but that whole postback / viewstate thing just confused me.  I was used to doing web applications the hard way and having this abstracted away from me into a semi-winform like representation of a web page just got in my way when building sites.  It also made them pretty hard to unit test. 

Having used (and even written) a few MVC frameworks in the past, I'm really interested to see what it is all about.  Looking forward for some more information soon.  [Jeff's post](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/10/05/altnetconf-scott-guthrie-announces-asp-net-mvc-framework-at-alt-net-conf.aspx) has a few tantilising details which make me thing this is exactly what I want from ASP.NET.
