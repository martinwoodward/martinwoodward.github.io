One of the great things about version control is that it covers a number of "Hit by a Bus" scenarios. I say this with an air of joviality, but each actual use case is never a nice one. I once worked with a guy, who supposedly once worked at a place where the "Hit By a Bus" scenario was a real one. Mostly you need them when a member of the team has had to leave at short notice because [they quit](http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/000143.html)/ were sacked / had a family emergency etc. Anyway, there are a number of times when you thank your chosen deity for the fact that you implemented a decent source control system giving you one less thing to worry about, especially when times are tough. Today, I [ran across a question on the MSDN forums](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2271260&SiteID=1&mode=1) where someone was having one of these days and as usual, it is time to dust off the [tf command line](<http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z51z7zy0(VS.80).aspx>), or fire up the [excellent TFS Sidekicks from Attrice](http://www.attrice.info/cm/tfs/index.htm) - in [this example](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2271260&SiteID=1&mode=1) it was to query history with a filter on the user that you want the history for.
