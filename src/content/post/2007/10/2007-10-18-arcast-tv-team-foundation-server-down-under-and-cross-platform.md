[](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=348628) Ron Jacobs has posted up an [ARCast](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/ARCast_with_Ron_Jacobs) video from [TechEd 2007 in Australia](http://www.microsoft.com/australia/teched07/index.aspx). About 3 minutes in he does a [nice interview with an organization using Team Foundation Server in a cross-platform environment](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=348628). While I spend a lot of time talking about the [performance of TFS over the WAN](http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/000169.html) and extending the benefits of Team Foundation Server outside of Visual Studio by using the [Teamprise Clients](http://www.teamprise.com/) as well as the [Microsoft MSSCCI provider](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=87E1FFBD-A484-4C3A-8776-D560AB1E6198&displaylang=en)(pronounced "Miss-key") - it is always nice to hear it from real people in a real company....

Anyway - if you have a spare 15 minutes, [go take a look](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=348628).
