[](http://www.microsoft.com/europe/teched-developers)I'm joining my good friend [Brian Randell](http://mcwtech.com/cs/blogs/brianr/) to do a session on Team Build 2008 at [TechEd Developers in Barcelona](http://www.mseventseurope.com/teched/07/developers/content/Pages/Default.aspx) on November 8th. If you are at TechEd then please do come along - it is shaping up to be a fun talk. If you can't make it to the talk, then I'll be loitering around the Team System Ask The Experts area during other times. Feel free to drop me a line if you want to meet up.

**TLA316 Code It and Ship It with Team Build 2008
**Brian Randell , Martin Woodward

This session covers how to define an end-to-end build process using Team System and Team Build 2008. First you'll learn what's new and changed from Team Build 2005. You'll learn how to manage the build, do desktop builds, and how you can setup Team Build to work in a continuous integration environment. You'll then learn how to customize the build process to perform all your build steps including running unit tests, creating custom build actions, generating setup programs and deploying to staging servers. Finally, you'll get a crash course in the new managed API for working with Team Build 2008.
