The new "Gutsy Gibbon" version of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) was officially [released](http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu710) this week.  While some of the developers at Teamprise use Ubuntu as their primary OS, I personally prefer Windows Vista, however I keep an Ubuntu image around so that I can quickly test any new UI code I write in an alternate OS.  Getting Ubuntu to install in VMWare is pretty trivial - the standard installation seems to work just fine.  However getting it to work in Microsoft Virtual PC is a little more complicated - the various tricks are located in various forum and bug posts around the web that I can never find when I need them so I am collating them here for my own use later - hopefully you may also find them useful.  Please bear in mind that I know enough about Linux to be dangerous rather than useful, so this may not be the "best" way - however it is my way ;-)
