If you are/were planning on using that Beta 2 VPC of Team System or TFS that you downloaded after November 1st, then think again.  [Jeff Beehler](http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffbe) has posted to warn folks that the group have recently discovered that the VPC will expire early due to the timeout in the operating system.  See [Jeff's post](http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffbe/archive/2007/10/25/vs2008-beta2-vpcs-expiring-prematurely.aspx) for more details.
