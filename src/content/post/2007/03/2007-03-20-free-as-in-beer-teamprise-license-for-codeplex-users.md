Today, I am pleased to [announce](http://www.teamprise.com/news/2007/03/teamprise_enables_crossplatfor.html) that Teamprise are offering complimentary licenses of the Teamprise client suite for anyone wanting to use Teamprise to connect to an open source project on CodePlex.  If you want to take advantage of this offer, see [the sign up page](http://www.teamprise.com/partners/codeplex.py). 

For those of you who don't know, Teamprise offers three clients to help you talk to Visual Studio Team Foundation Server (TFS) from outside of Visual Studio 2005.  They are:-  [Teamprise plug-in for Eclipse](http://www.teamprise.com/product/plugin_eclipse.html) - A plug-in to TFS that gives you full IDE integration inside an Eclipse based IDE.  [Teamprise Explorer](http://www.teamprise.com/product/explorer_client.html) - A stand-alone GUI client for TFS that will runs using native look and feel on multiple platforms including Windows Vista, Windows XP, Mac OS X, GTK Linux, Solaris etc etc  [Teamprise Command Line Client](http://www.teamprise.com/product/command-line.html) - A command line client for TFS familiar in operation to Microsoft's tf.exe only ours runs from any platform with the necessary Java JRE 

Why are we making this offer?  It was a bit of a no-brainier really.  We'd heard about some projects that wanted to move to CodePlex but couldn't because some of the developers were not running Windows.  We have the necessary technology developed so it would make sense to get it in the hands of as many people as possible.  Also, Teamprise relies on many open source projects to make a living (not least of which is the Eclipse project) - so it seemed like the decent thing to do to offer complimentary licenses to Teamprise for anyone working on an Open Source project. 

Don't forget, as well as these clients, if you want to integrate your project build environment then you can take a look at the [Ant](http://www.teamprise.com/download/download-ant.html) and [CruiseControl](http://www.teamprise.com/download/download-cc.html) integrations we recently made available. 

I'm excited to see who takes us up on this offer and which projects make CodePlex their new home.  It's also good to see some choice in the open source project hosting space.  Personally, I'm a fan of the way the CodePlex service works and love the fact that new features are coming out all the time from the team.  If any one has any questions, concerns or comments about this offer then feel free to head over to the [Teamprise forums](http://support.teamprise.com/).
