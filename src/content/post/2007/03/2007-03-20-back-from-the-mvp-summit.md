I'm safely back from a fantastic week at the MVP Summit in Seattle / Redmond.  The week itself was very enjoyable and packed with tons of useful information - thanks to [Noah](http://blogs.msdn.com/noahc/) and the VSTS team for being our hosts for the week.  While I knew several of my fellow [Team System MVP's](https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/communities/mvp.aspx?product=1&competency=Visual+Developer+-+Team+System) from previous brief meetings, I've come away from the week with several new friends.  For some photos of the event see [Noah's](http://blogs.msdn.com/noahc/archive/2007/03/14/team-system-mvps-on-campus.aspx) and [Willy](http://dotnet.org.za/willy/) blogs. 

My journey home was nothing short of epic due to some [weather difficulties in the New York area over St Patrick's day weekend](http://www.cnn.com/2007/TRAVEL/03/17/stranded.flights.ap/index.html).  It was one of those journeys that will go down in the Woodward Chronicles of Nightmare Travel Experiences (that always seem to happen on my way home - never on my way to an event).  Now that I have caught up on my sleep, the journey was actually quite funny and (believe it or not) a little bit life changing.  I've just had a phone call to let me know that my checked baggage is on a Taxi ride to my house at the moment as it took an independent route across the world to the one I chose but amazingly seems to have made it into the same country only a couple of days after I did.
