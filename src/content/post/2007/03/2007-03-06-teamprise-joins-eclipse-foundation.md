This afternoon at EclipseCon, Corey (my boss) announced that [Teamprise has joined the Eclipse Foundation](http://www.teamprise.com/news/2007/03/teamprise_joins_eclipse_foundation.html).  This is exciting news for us and goes well with our status as a Microsoft Visual Studio Industry Partner - demonstrating our commitment to both platforms.  If you want to see the [official press release](http://www.teamprise.com/news/2007/03/teamprise_joins_eclipse_foundation.html) then head over to the [Teamprise web site](http://www.teamprise.com/news/2007/03/teamprise_joins_eclipse_foundation.html).  While Corey was at the show he also took the opportunity to give the first public outing of Teamprise 2.1 (which is due any day now) and hopefully show the Eclipse folks what Team Foundation Server can do for them.   

Fingers-crossed that his presentation went well - what the crowd won't have noticed is the fact that his main computer died on him late last week and he had to rapidly set up a different machine.  People who follow [Eric's blog](http://www.ericsink.com/) will know that we don't have a [good track record with exhibition machines](http://www.ericsink.com/entries/tech_06jun2005.html) - I found this out for myself on a [recent visit to Barcelona](http://www.woodwardweb.com/personal/000300.html)...
