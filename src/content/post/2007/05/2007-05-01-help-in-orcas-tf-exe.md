[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/HelpinOrcastf.exe_BB18/Visual%20Studio%20Codename%20Orcas%20Command%20Prompt%5B2%5D.png)Ahh, in Beta 1 of the Team Explorer client, if you type "tf" in a Visual Studio command prompt, you get back help in the console, rather than a window popping up taking you to the MSDN help. To get the old behaviour you can type "tf msdn". Sweet. I suspect this is the first of many small changes in Orcas that I'm really going to like.
