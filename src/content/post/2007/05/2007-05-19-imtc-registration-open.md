If the recent announcements about Silverlight have your interest and you can get to Dublin on June 7th this year then I would urge you to take a look at this years [Irish community conference IMTC](http://imtc.firstport.ie/).  It used to be called INDC but they had to drop the "D" because there is sooo much more to the event than just developer stuff. 

Folks who went to the event last year will remember the highlight of the event were the talks and hand-on sessions with [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/).  This year, I suspect the highlight will be the Silverlight sessions from [Tim Sneath](http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/default.aspx) - group manager for Silverlight and WPF. 

These conferences are ran by the combined [Microsoft Techology user groups of Ireland](http://www.mtug.ie/) and are a great opportunity to catch up on what it going on, have great talks from world class presenters and chat with your fellow techies - which is always the best bit.  The conferences are always very personal.  The event is being organised by the community for the community, but they have managed to attract some generous sponsors which means they have managed to keep the costs down to only â‚¬50 per person. 

If you can make it to Dublin I would strongly encourage you to go.  You'd be hard pressed to get such great content in one place along with the chance to interact with the presenters. 

**When**: June 7th, 9am till late (It's an Irish event after all...)
**Where**: [Cineworld complex](http://www.cineworld.ie/) , Dublin
**Cost**: [50 euros](http://imtc.firstport.ie/book.aspx) (to help cover costs). 
**Website: **[http://imtc.firstport.ie/](http://imtc.firstport.ie/) 

With 18 sessions from amazing speakers, this is one event that you will not want to miss. They are covering everything from the new Silverlight and Expression products (very exciting!) to WCF, Biztalk, SQL Server, Longhorn Server, Security, Mobile technologies, Card Space and even Game Development with the XNA framework with some robotics thrown in as well. 

[Book now](http://imtc.firstport.ie/book.aspx) before it is sold out.
