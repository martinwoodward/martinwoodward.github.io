This morning we had a power cut which killed a particular tricky upgrade mid-way through trashing the machine I was attempting it on.  Luckily the machine in question was a VM Ware image and I had recent taken a backup snap-shot so I only lost a few hours work. 

When the power returned I went out to the ([now infamous](http://www.woodwardweb.com/personal/000347.html)) garage to switch on the machine I have running out there that acts as a VPN Gateway, TFS Proxy ([the world's smallest](http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/000273.html)) and Build Mirror which allows my network to seamlessly be part of the main Teamprise network.   

However it would not boot.  Being the technical minded English guy that I am, I unplugged the computer, went back inside and made myself a cup of tea in the hope that it would magically fix itself. 

When I returned, I discovered that usually foolproof trick of simply ignoring the problem had let me down and it was going to be much messier than that.  I brought the machine into my office, opened it up and instantly saw the problem - a set of rather sick looking capacitors on my motherboard. 

At this point, I figured I was just going to have to get a new machine.  Having recently got a fancy new workstation, I was not looking forward to breaking this news to my boss.  I hopped onto the Internet to see what the cheapest machine I could get was when I discovered that this was a [reasonably well known problem with my Dell SX270 motherboard](http://news.com.com/PCs+plagued+by+bad+capacitors/2100-1041_3-5942647.html?tag=item), and better yet [Dell was doing an out-of-warranty repair program](http://warrantypartsdirect.dell.com/us/program/T1910000.ASP) to fix them. 

I gave Dell a call fully expecting to get the brush off, but after about 5 minutes talking to 3 people around the globe, I got through to a chap who has arranged for an engineer to come to the office tomorrow and replace the motherboard - free of charge. 

This is a much abused and unloved machine that has been running more-or-less 24 hours a day since I bought it several years ago. Just as it was about to go to the great landfill in the sky, it sounds like it is going to get a new lease of life.  Sounds to good to be true - I'll let you know how the appointment with the Dell Engineer goes tomorrow.
