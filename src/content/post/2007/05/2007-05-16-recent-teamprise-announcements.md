I've just got back into the office after a week and a bit on vacation and was pleased to see a few announcements have been made while I was off sunning myself. We will be making our [Java API for TFS](http://www.teamprise.com/news/2007/05/teamprise_announces_java_sdk_f.html) available for license later in the year We released [2.1.2 of Teamprise Client Suite](http://www.teamprise.com/download/index.html)

The [Java API](http://www.teamprise.com/news/2007/05/teamprise_announces_java_sdk_f.html) thing just makes sense. We've always had our API as a seperate component (which we call "Core") and this is very discrete from the UI and CLC clients. Making this available to others will hopefully be a good thing and increase the number of Team Foundation Server enabled products in the maket place.

[Version 2.1.2](http://www.teamprise.com/download/index.html) of the client suite is a minor maintanence release in response to customer feedback we had recieved. It ranges from the cosmetic (changing the example URL label when running with a CodePlex license key), to some bug fixes to the odd feature we have slipped in (a version of the getcs command based on that available in the Microsoft powertoy). For full details on what is in the 2.1.2 release then take a look at the [release notes](http://download.teamprise.com/cs/2.1.2.5563R/release-notes/release-notes.html).
