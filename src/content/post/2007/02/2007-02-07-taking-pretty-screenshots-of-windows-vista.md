The Vista Aero interface is awesome - but capturing that beauty has always been hard for me. All that changed this morning when [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com) put me on to an awesome tool by [Kenny Kerr](http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/default.aspx). [Kenny Kerr's Windows Clippings 1.5](http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2007/01/28/window-clippings-1-5.aspx) is simply the best capture tool for Windows Vista that I have used. I am probably the last person in the world to hear about it, but on the off-chance that I am the second to last, here are some of the things I like and why you should use it:- It can capture shadows, transparency etc really well. However, it can magically take out all the cruft that you get from background windows coming through. When you are doing a screen capture - the effect that is used while you are selecting the windows is suitably beautiful for a capture tool that takes such nice pictures. Screen shots are saved in a file name using the window name of the application you were taking a screenshot of.

It does one thing and does it really, really well. Thanks [Jeff](http://www.codinghorror.com) for the top tip! For a little user-guide on how to use Kenny's excellent tool see [his post](http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/pages/using-window-clippings.aspx) (with pretty pictures) [here](http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/pages/using-window-clippings.aspx).
