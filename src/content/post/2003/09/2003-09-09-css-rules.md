One of my collegues pointed me at the [css Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/).  I have to admit, I knew CSS was powerful - but I had always avoided learning it due to the flakey support in some browsers.  Now [nearly everyone](http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html) is using a decent browser it may be time to stop using tables for layout purposes.

I always knew that table layouts were to be avoided to make sites accessible but I had never really found a better way - until now.  I think I may just have to rebuild this site...
