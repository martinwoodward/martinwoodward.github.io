Just had a look at this page on the [Eurdora web browser](http://www.eudora.com/internetsuite/eudoraweb.html) (on the palm) and it works really well. It seems to use the stylesheets but igore the *display:none* bit. 

It is text only on my m125 however due to the re-design it still works fine. I guess dropping tables was the right way to go!
