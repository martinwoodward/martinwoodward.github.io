MIT course note are now available online at  [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html).  This reminds me of the time I attended a full lecture course and actually typed up the notes.  It was about the only exam I passed.  Anyway, if you are interested in learning more about anything from anthropology to particle physics then this looks good.
