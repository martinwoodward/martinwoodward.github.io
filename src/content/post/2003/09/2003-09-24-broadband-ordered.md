My order for broadband has just gone in to [Nildram](http://www.nildram.com).  Decided to go with them in the end as I wanted a static ip address with an email account and webspace etc.  According to [ADSL Guide](http://www.adslguide.org.uk) they have been consistently rated as one of the fastest ISP's.  I have also heard nothing but good things about their Customer Service.   Just have to wait until after the 15th October for ADSL to be installed into my [local exchange](http://www.stocksfieldbroadband.co.uk).  Not that I mind the wait too much - after all I live in an area that cannot even get [Freeview](http://www.freeview.co.uk) or even Channel 5.
