Went to see the new [Matrix](http://www.matrix.com) film - Revolutions. My expectations weren't that high as the reviews I had read were not particularly encouraging. However, it was okay. Worth seeing to pass the evening. It didn't stand up as a film in it's own right but the effects were good. Thinking of seeing [Kill Bill](http://www.kill-bill.com) next week.
