I'm currently doing a budget (January is always a long month, but this one will be particularly hard as my personal circumstances have changed rather a lot in the past year).  I released that I had a new category to add to my usual food & drink, utilities, mortgage etc.  I now have a separate section for "Information Subscriptions".  Into this goes items such as my [broadband](http://www.nildram.com/), [Sky+](http://www.sky.com/skyplus/), [New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/) and [PC Plus](http://www.pcplus.co.uk/) Subscriptions (among others).  I realized how much I spend a year on information (currently just under GBP 1000), and how I consider such thinks important in my everyday life.  It makes you realize what a different time we live in compared to just 20 years ago.
