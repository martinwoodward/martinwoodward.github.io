I am now back on the first page of [Google](http://www.google.co.uk/) when you [search for Martin Woodward](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=Martin+Woodward).  Not sure what's changed as I still have the same number of links to my site.  I think perhaps it is because the [discussion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Podcasting) of the Wikipedia definition for "[Podcasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting)" very kindly links to me, and this definition is now linked to in many places - including news.bbc.co.uk (which seems to have near infinite page rank).  However, I am still "below the fold" on Google, i.e. you have to scroll down to find me.  

I'm also getting towards the end of some long hours at work (hence the lack of posting recently), so I think it is time to return to doing some stuff in the evenings and contributing back into the community (but more importantly do some programming just for fun).  One of the things I have noticed is that people often are very kind and recognise the work you have done, the best form of recognition for me is a link back to my site - improving my pagerank some more.  Unless of course you want to get something from [my Amazon Wishlist](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/registry/J6QYKH3Q33OG/woodwardwebcom) ;-)
