Just wanted to take the time to plug the [JavaCoder.Net](http://www.javacoder.net) web site - a handy site put together by one of my pals that is helping me stay in touch with the world of [Java](http://www.javacoder.net). If you get the time, please take a look. It's very fast and completely free of adverts.

The bit of the site I really like is the rapid way of accessing information about [java design patterns](http://www.javacoder.net/patterns.jsp) (much quicker than Sun's site). The [java discussion forum](http://www.javacoder.net/forum) is also worth a look and I would encorage you to contribute to make the site richer.
