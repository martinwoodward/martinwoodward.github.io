[Skype](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1724271-10386659)have done it again. Using the latest windows beta version (1.4.0.47) you now have access to Call Forwarding features. If you are offline or do not answer a skype call then you can configure Skype to automatically forward the call to your landline or cell phone (using your Skypeout credit to pay the the forwarded portion of the call). This feature works even when all your computers are offline (in the latest version of the clients offline users who have call forwarding enabled have a new icon to show their status). This means that people can call my Skypein number or Skype me and they'll get through to my mobile phone if I'm not at the computer. Crazy.
