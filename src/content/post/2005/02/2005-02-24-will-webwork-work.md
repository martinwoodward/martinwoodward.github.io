Heard about [WebWork](http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork_old/) from a few different sources lately.  I hate Struts with a passion (especially in large teams) and find the aspx framework in .NET gets in the way between what I know I want to do and the implementation.  I have ended up writing a few of web frameworks in the past in different langauges (including Net.Data, remember that anyone?).  Anyway this post is a note for me to go check out [WebWork](http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork_old/) and see what it does.  Any comments about it are gratefully recieved to the usual email address or in this post (if it is working - I am overdue a change in blog software aswell...)
