Recently, I've been trying to access some Microsoft webcasts but they just have not been working on my work PC.  I got an error when media player tried to download the codec.  Eventually tracked this down to needing the VoiceAge codec and not being able to find it.

If you have the same problem, you could try downloading and installing the codec manually from [here](http://www.voiceage.com/codecsite/media/acelpacm.exe).  Works for me!
