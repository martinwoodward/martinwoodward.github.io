Well. It had to happen. I seem to have disappeared from [Google](http://www.google.com) when you do a search for "Martin Woodward". My iPodder profile now shows up at the number 2 slot, but I've no idea how to edit this profile to include a link back to my page. I give up, I am destined to be ignored by Google and i am going to lie back and relish my anomicity instead. If you use [MSN Search](http://search.msn.com/) then I'm number two (depending on which country you do the search from of course), however _nobody_ uses MSN Search so I should stay happily anonymous.

**Update [16 Feb 2005]: ** So it looks like my mrwpro.com domain name has jumped in again at the number 3 slot. Don't know what the heck is going on. But I've given up caring right...
