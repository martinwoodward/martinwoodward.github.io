Sorry about the lack of posts lately.  Had lots on at work and then lots on at home when I eventually get there so been too busy to play and find things of interest.

Just for interest these are the [podcasts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting) that I listen to on my long commute.  If anyone has any recomendations for me then let me know.  Techie stuff or science type stuff is cool (anything that keeps me up to date with what is going on).  Comedy would also be good.

Still using [nimiq](http://www.nimiq.nl) client BTW.  Pretty good, but still not quite there for me.  The iPodder Lemon V2 sounds interesting - will be giving it a try.
