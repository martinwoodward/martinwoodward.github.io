[](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1856869717/woodwardwebcom)It has been ages since I have read any fiction.  I am doing quite a few miles in the car at the moment and have little time to sit down with a book to relax.  Last week, I was very kindly given "[The Broker](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1844131629/woodwardwebcom)", the new book by John Grisham - but as an audio book.

[Podcasts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting) are good to help pass the time in the car (and have the advantage of being free) but following the story of Marco trying to survive in Italy has made a nice change.  Some of John Grisham's observations on Europe have been painfully incorrect at times, and I obviously have to suspend my technical head when he talks about the latest Smart Phones or hacking a super secret satellite system.  It follows the same Grisham formula and is un-challenging.  I love it! - great fun to listen to.  I would recommend you take a [read](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1844131629/woodwardwebcom) or a [listen](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1856869717/woodwardwebcom) if you have the time.
