[](http://www.nimiq.nl/)I have been driven to desperation with [iPodder](http://ipodder.sourceforge.net/), so thought I would go looking for another podcast client before I wrote my own.  Looks like the guys at [nimiq](http://www.nimiq.nl/) have beat me to it and done a great job!   Don't think they will be able to open source it for a while as they seem to be using some closed source controls (such as [Rebar](http://www.skybound.ca/developer/rebar/default.aspx)).  The software appears to work brilliantly (even with bittorrent feeds such as [DotNotRocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com) and [SlashDotReview](http://www.slashdotreview.com))

Anyway, iPodder has now been removed from my system and I'm going to use [nimiq](http://www.nimiq.nl/) for a while - let's hope they keep up the great work and possibly release the code in the future, it has a *working* C# implementation of a Bittorrent client that I would love to see.
