Just a quick post to say that my old buddy [Jez Stephenson](http://www.jezstephenson.f2s.com/blog/) has started blogging. Why don't you [pop by](http://www.jezstephenson.f2s.com/blog/) and leave him some abuse? He is also setting up a new affilliate site "[Quick Sound](http://www.quicksound.co.uk/)" selling [guitars](http://www.quicksound.co.uk/) and [music equipment](http://www.quicksound.co.uk/). Rumour has it that he is thinking of getting into podcasting...
