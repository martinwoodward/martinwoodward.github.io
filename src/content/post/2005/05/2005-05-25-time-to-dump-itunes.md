Via [Wired](http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,67593,00.html), there is now a WinAmp plugin that allows you to sync your iPod from WinAmp.  Called [mlipod](http://www.mlipod.com/), it also allows you to copy songs from your iPod back onto your computer - fantastic.  Anyone know a plugin for WinAmp that downloads Podcasts?
