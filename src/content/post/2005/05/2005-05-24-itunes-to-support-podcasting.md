According to [Steve Gilmor](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Gillmor/), [Apple's iTunes is to support enclosures in RSS feeds](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Gillmor/?p=101) (podcasting).  I have been looking for more details on this and have not found any yet so I could have mis-read the article but it would be a sensible move for Apple.  Podcast's were the reason I bought an iPod and so the reason I had to install the iTunes software (which I don't particularly like BTW) and therefore the reason why I started looking at the iTunes music store.  Hopefully the inroduction of a podcast client in iTunes will mean I get a podcatching setup that works reliably....

**Update:**  The BBC have posted a story about the [podcast support in iTunes](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4575075.stm).  The BBC have also extended their [podcast trial](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/downloadtrial/).  I think that happened around the 19th May but I've been working late recently so not been posting.
