A few people have asked me this recently, so this is the current list of podcasts that I subscribe to and enjoy on my daily commute.

[.NET Rocks!](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/) - *The* internet audio talkshow for dotnet developers.

[Slashdot Review](http://www.slashdotreview.com/) - A daily review of items of interest on Slashdot read by a southern guy.  This is one of my favourite podcasts and the production quality is spot on.  The featured garage band at the end is sometimes a pleasure, and sometimes something I just fast forward (the power of podcasts!)

[Daily Source Code](http://www.curry.com) - The "Podfather" Adam Curry talks about podcasting and stuff.  Not sure why I find this entertaining but I do, I think I got hooked on the cow-bells.

[Slacker Astronomy](http://www.slackerastronomy.org/) - Nice astronomy podcast.  The script is really good and the subject matter just right, sadly the people that read it are a bit wooden but they do this for fun and get better every show.

[Dr Karl podcast](http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/stn/podcast.htm) - Dr Karl's Tripple J phone in show because you just can't hear daytime scientific debate about farting on the BBC.

[Gilmore Daily](http://gillmordaily.podshow.com/) - A new addition to my podroll, so far so good.

[In Business](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/news/inbusiness/index.shtml) - Peter Day's great show from Radio 4.
