[Bill Caputo](http://www.williamcaputo.com/) has posted an interesting article discussing [inheritance in C#, especially when using interfaces](http://www.williamcaputo.com/archives/000138.html). I learned about OO while learning how to write Java, so I still struggle with the fact that methods in C# are not virtual by default. [Bill](http://www.williamcaputo.com/) explains why inheriting a class that implements an interface might not work as you expected.

The key statement here is:-

...the implementation of an interface method is implicitly 'final', just as if the 'sealed' and 'override' modifiers were present.

Anyway, worth reading. I think I might be getting myself a copy of [.NET Essentials](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201734117/woodwardwebcom)...
