Fantastic, the [EAP for Resharper 2.0 is open for public download](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/Download).  Cannot wait to install this as I've really been missing Resharper in Visual Studio 2005 (writing Using statements is soo 2003).  I just hope ctrl-shift-n is in there already (remember, ctrl-shift-n is the new ctrl-n).  Will post and let you know how I get on.
