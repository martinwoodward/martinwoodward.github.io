[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/images/blog/itunes_podcasts.html)I downloaded version 4.9 of iTunes today that contains support for Podcasts.  Overall it seems ok, very easy to use but no support for Bittorrent which means I'll be sticking with nimiq for a while yet to keep up to date with [DotNetRocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com).  For more information about this version, take a look at [iPodLounge](http://www.ipodlounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/the-complete-guide-to-itunes-49-with-podcasts/).

For more info about how to get your RSS feed integrated with the iTune Music Store (and iTunes specific tags), see [http://phobos.apple.com/static/podcast_specifications.pdf](http://phobos.apple.com/static/podcast_specifications.pdf).

**UPDATE:**Carl Franklin has just posted a comment to say that [DotNetRocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com) has reverted back to standard download feeds to allow people to use iTunes as a client while the Bittorrent thing is sorted out.
