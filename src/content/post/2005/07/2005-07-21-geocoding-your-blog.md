I'm about to go traveling, so I'm figuring out how to geocode my blog so that I can use the data to display where I happen to be when I post the blog entry.  Mostly for my reference while I figure it out, here are the references I am using:-[Geotagging Web Pages and RSS Feeds](http://interactive.linuxjournal.com/node/8025/) article by Andrew Turner[WordKit Users Manual](http://www.brainoff.com/worldkit/doc/weblogs.php)[Multimap](http://www.multimap.com)[A2B](http://www.a2b.cc/)
