Just a quick sample to see if I can put stuff into IE's clipboard. Click [here](<javascript:void(0);>) to copy "Hello World!" into the clipboard. Obviously, if I can put stuff in the clipboard, I can see what you happend to leave in it as well...

Uses the [window.clipboardData](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/objects/clipboarddata.asp) method.
