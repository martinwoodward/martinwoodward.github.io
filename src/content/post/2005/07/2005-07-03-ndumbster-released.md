Thanks to a load of great work from Alexis Kartmann, the [nDumbster](http://ndumbster.sourceforge.net/) project is now in a state that I would recommend it's use for real world projects.  

[nDumbster](http://ndumbster.sourceforge.net/) is a .Net port of the [Dumbster](http://quintanasoft.com/dumbster/) project which is maintained by Jason Kitchen.  nDumbster allows you to easily set up a dummy SMTP server in your xUnit tests and then query the messages that the server has received.  Very handy for testing mail based code.  

Anyway, if you are writing .Net based code that wants to talk to a mail server then take some time to look at [nDumbster](http://ndumbster.sourceforge.net/) and let us know if you need it to do anything else.  If you want to do a similar thing from Java then pop along to Jason's [Dumbster](http://quintanasoft.com/dumbster/) project.
