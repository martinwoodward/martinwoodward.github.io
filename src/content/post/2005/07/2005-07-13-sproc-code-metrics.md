At the risk of prompting someone to ask for them, [Dan Fernandez](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/) has posted a neat [stored procedure utility](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2005/07/10/437312.aspx) that inspects your sprocs and can give you come basic code metrics on them as well.

If any managers are reading, just remember that code metrics are not a direct measure of productivity.  If I spend a week on some existing code and the number of lines of code in it have gone down then I consider that to be a good week....
