I've been struggling with a [known issue with nDoc](http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/content/knownissues.htm) where it tries to generate filenames that are bigger than 256 characters.  So instead of generating my documentation within the build folder, which is under the project folder - I'm going to have to create a temp directory at the root of my current drive with a really short directory name and create the documentation within it.  The problem I had was figuring out what my current drive was.  Answer:

<echo message="${[directory::get-directory-root](http://nant.sourceforge.net/release/0.85-rc3/help/functions/directory.get-directory-root.html)('.')}" />

Probably an easier way, but this'll do for now.
