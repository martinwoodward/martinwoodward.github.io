I'm loving the new Generics support in C# 2.0 - may I never use the vanilla System.Collections namespace again. Syntactically, generics in C# and Java are quite smiliar, but there are some important differences under the hood of the VM (or CLR). There is an intersting converstation between Bill Venners and Anders Hejlsberg posted [here](http://www.artima.com/intv/generics2.html) on the topic of the C# and Java implementations of Generics. Basically, the IL for .NET 2.0 understands generics, but the 1.5 JVM does not.
