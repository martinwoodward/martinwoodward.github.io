This site may dissappear for some spells over the next few days.  I'm currently in the process of moving house so it may take a while to get the old server located in my new garage.  The good news is that I have some Cat5 cabling in the new house and a fancy 3Com router courtesy of [Clark Sell](http://www.csell.net).  The bad news is that my broadband is not due to get installed until Friday.  The good news about the bad news is that my line is getting upgraded from 512 kps to 2Mpbs!  We'll soon see if it works...
