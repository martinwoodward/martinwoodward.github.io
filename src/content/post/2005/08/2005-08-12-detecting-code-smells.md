I sometimes come across code that I consider posting to [The Daily WTF](http://thedailywtf.com/), but I find the old career preservation instincts usually kick in.  One of the most common problems occur when code is copy/pasted into lots of places.  Tonight I accidentally stumbled upon this little tool for java - the [copy/paste detector](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html).  Nice - the web site has links to the algorithims that are used.  If I had the spare time I might get this working against C# code, but I have too many sourceforge projects open at the moment.  Thinking about it, another great tool would be a plugin to word that could scan a document and hook into the google web api to find where sections had been lifted from - might have helped with '[that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgy_Dossier)' dossier...
