I've been a keen user of [Konfabulator](http://www.konfabulator.com) for a while now.  I even paid for a couple of licenses in the pre-Yahoo days.  It's really easy to hack up your own widgets, and I have a strange self-distructive streak that means I enjoy writing in javascript every now and then.

Today, I've just noticed a load of familiar looking exe files in:-

C:\Program Files\Pixoria\Konfabulator\UnixUtils\usr\local\wbin

With names like ls.exe, grep.exe, less.exe, curl.exe.  Fire up a command shell and they are (you guessed it) ports of handy little unix utils.  I now feel inspired to write a pretty version of tail for windows...
