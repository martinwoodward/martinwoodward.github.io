If you had the mis-fortune of hearing me speak at the Belfast launch event for  SQL 2005 / Visual Studio 2005 / Biztalk 2006 this morning then the following links may be of interest:-[Rob Caron's Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/robcaron/default.aspx) - Best place for VSTS related information

[Visual Studio Team System](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/) - Official Microsoft pages

[VSTSPlugins](http://vstsplugins.sourceforge.net/) - Open source integrations with VSTS, including the CruiseControl.NET integration demonstrated

[CruiseControl.NET](http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/) - The Continuous Integration build server

[Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com/) - Access VSTS from inside Eclipse running on Windows, Mac OS X or Linux

Update:  If you are after the times I quoted for VSS vs VSTS then see [this post.](http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/000169.html)
