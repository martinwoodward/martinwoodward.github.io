[](/images/blog/geomap.html)Well, despite the massive load that Google Analytics took, they have done me proud and are now happily tracking the data from 3 of the sites I look after that I'm most interested in. This blog, [VSTSPlugins](http://vstsplugins.sourceforge.net) and [VSTSEclipse](http://www.vstseclipse.org).

First surprise was that my blog actually gets quite a few hits - significantly more than the other two sites. While we are only talking 100's in a day, it is still a lot more than I thought - and that doesn't include those people who read all my content using RSS. I only really write stuff here of interest to myself or when I don't find something in Google and have to work it out. Anyway, it's nice to have you. I might pay more attention to my spelling and grammar now that I know people are reading.

The next surprise was how distributed around the world people where (see a [screenshot](/images/blog/geomap.html) of the very nice GeoMap overlay feature). Previously I'd assumed that most of the traffic was folks I've worked with before. While I recognised many of the connecting domains, there are a good few I don't which is nice.

Finally, it was good to see a large firefox population for this blog (just over 30% with the rest of the lion's share going to IE). I also have a nice spread of OS's including Windows Vista, Mac, Linux, SunOS and the odd splattering of mobile devices.

Anyway, hopefully [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics) will open it's doors again soon for new users so others can benefit from the fantastic data and great UI that it provides. All for free as well - amazing.
