I colleague of mine, Mike Cooper, just pointed me towards the "[Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/business/employment/0,39020648,2111465,00.htm)".  Hopefully not because he thinks I need to heed the advice - but it is always good to think about your own behaviour when revewing and pairing.  Reading the article made me think back to the first code review sessions I've held with people where they often need to take things less personally, but also to some great pairing sessions I've had with people that really adhere to these rules whether they knew they did or not.  I can't help it, I'm in a retrospective mood just lately.
