Not that I'm obsessed or anything, but in the latest Google index (Mar 31, 2005 03:19:55 GMT) I am now the Number 1 Martin Woodward on the internet! Now you can go to Google's homepage, type Martin Woodward and press the "I'm feeling lucky" button to go straight to my homepage. All I need is to now actually post something here that is remotely interesting rather than just going on about my pagerank all the time...

**Update:** I now appear to hold the number 1 and 2 slots. Sweet. I guess the indexes will take a day or two to settle down from this last indexing.
