I've been playing with [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) lately. Coming from [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html), I find the interface really hard to use. Also, the number of windows that [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) generates it just plain annoying.

Obviously I'm not the only person in the world that thinks this as on March 30th [Scott Moschella](http://www.plasticbugs.com/) hacked [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) to make [GIMPShop](http://plasticbugs.com/index.php?p=241) with menu structures easily to use for ex-Photoshoppers. Then on Monday it was [ported to Windows](http://blog.yumdap.net/archives/20-GIMPshop-for-Windows.html) with an easy to use installer by [Dakira](http://blog.yumdap.net/). If you are wanting to try moving to [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) from [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html) then take a look at [GIMPShop for Windows](http://blog.yumdap.net/archives/20-GIMPshop-for-Windows.html). Don't you just love open source!
