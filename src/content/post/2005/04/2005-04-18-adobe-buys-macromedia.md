Wow,  [Adobe have announced plans to buy Macromedia](http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/adobeandmacromedia.html).  Guess I'll only be buying from one company in the future when I need to do creative stuff for the web.  Not sure what I think about this move, hope the price tag for Dreamweaver doesn't go up too much - what about the future of flash?  We live in interesting times...
