Apologies for the lack of posts recently. We are due a new release of my latest project at work in a couple of weeks and in my spare moments I have been investigating my new play project, a [VSTS plugin for Eclipse](http://www.vstseclipse.org). Anyway, I have just uploaded the website for the [VSTSEclipse](http://www.vstseclipse.org) project to sourceforge.

It is ages since I have done a static HTML website and not been messing around with some server side functionality or other. There are a couple of features I would like to add but didn't want to delve too deeply back into the world of php that I haven't touched for at least 4 years, possibly longer.

This site is not the most inspirational design I have ever done, but it is all div / css based, tested in IE 6 and Firefox 1.0.3 and I hope to post a handheld version of the stylesheet shortly. As ever there is hardly any content at the moment, but there you go - you would expect nothing less from me, it would all be spelt wrong anyway.

Take a look at let me know what you think. The project itself is really interesting and quite challenging. Looking forward to getting stuck in to it (just need to finish off installing Beta 2 of VSTS at home).
