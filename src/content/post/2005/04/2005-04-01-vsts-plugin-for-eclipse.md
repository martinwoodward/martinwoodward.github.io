In an effort to keep my Java skills up to date while also using some of my new-found dotnet knowledge I've joined the team trying to put together a [VSTS SCC plugin for Eclipse](http://www.vstseclipse.org) that talks to the source control functionality in Visual Studio Team System.  It is early days yet but it is an interesting goal and I hope to learn some interesting stuff while putting something together that will be useful for the wider community.  If the only thing I accomplish is to get the wonderful Eclipse Diff tool hooked into VSTS then I'll be very happy (the one in VS 2005 is still not as good as the Eclipse one, if a little better than the appalling  diff tool that ships with VSS 6).
