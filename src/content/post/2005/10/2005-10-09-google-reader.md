As you've probably discovered by now, Google has launched [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) - a web based RSS reader with all the fancy AJAX lovliness you'd expect.

So far, I'm a little dissapointed. The site looks nice, and the keyboard shortcuts work well - but I had loads of problems importing my subscription list - also the performance is a little slow. I tend to read my feeds in categories, and there are some categories that I care more about reading every artcile whereas others that are very high volume and I just scan the headlines.

Basically, Google Reader is interesting but [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) has my RSS traffic still. I expect Google Reader will start working better as time goes on, at first I didn't like gmail that much...
