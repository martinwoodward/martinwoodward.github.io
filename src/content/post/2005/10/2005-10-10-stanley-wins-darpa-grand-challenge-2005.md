This years [DARPA Grand Challenge](http://www.grandchallenge.org/) has seen a winner.  [Stanley](http://www.stanfordracing.org/), the modified VW Toureg from Stanford University, completed the 131 mile off-road course with a 19 mph average speed.  [Stanford University News](http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/may18/darpasr-051805.html) has an excellent article, I'm sure there are more articles to follow.
