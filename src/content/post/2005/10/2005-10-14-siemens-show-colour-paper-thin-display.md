This week Siemens have demonstrated a cheap paper thin display using OLED technology.  Sounds very promising, they are talking about displays being manufactured using print style processes making displays cheap enough to appear in magazines.  See [The Guardian](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2005/10/14/paper_view_technology_.html) or [Physorg](http://www.physorg.com/news7079.html) for more information.
