Over the weekend, I put up a website for my [VSTSPlugins](http://vstsplugins.sourceforge.net) project - a home for [open source VSTS Plugins](http://vstsplugins.sourceforge.net). So far I've put up a CruiseControl.NET source control plugin. I have a nAnt plugin in the pipeline but I need to convert them to VSTS Beta 3 as the API's have changed names a lot between betas (to get rid of codenames etc).

This was also the first time I've played with Wordpress. I've got to admit that I'm very impressed. I think I'll be switching this site over from MoveableType if I can be bothered re-implementing my templates.
