Finally got round to packaging up and releasing a [CC.NET plugin for VSTS](http://vstsplugins.sourceforge.net/index.php/archives/news/2005/8) compiled against VSTS Beta 3. Great thanks to Troy Gould who did all the changes to the source files from the Beta 2 version. Now all I need to post some instuctions to give people a clue as to how to install it...
