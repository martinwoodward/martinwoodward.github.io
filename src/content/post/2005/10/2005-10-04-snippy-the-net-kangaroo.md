A new version of [Snippy](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=b0813ae7-466a-43c2-b2ad-f87e4ee6bc39) is out. For those of you not familiar - you'll be sorry to hear that Snippy is not a replacement to [Clippy](http://tastytronic.net/main/clippy.jpg) in Office 12, nor is it a [helpful marsupial that will rescue Timmy from down the well](http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/tv/kids/skippy.htm). Snippy is a handy little tool to help you edit code snippets in VS 2005.

After using Live Templates in [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and then with [Resharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper) in VS 2003, I was very surprised that you had to go out into [Notepad](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) when you wanted to edit code snippets in VS 2005. I kept thinking that this was because the software was in beta. As the beta's kept coming the feature was still missing. There are some "code-snippet project" features now, but it is a bit heavyweight to fire up a whole project just to edit one XML file. I couldn't believe a whole episode of [DotNetRocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showID=131) was devoted to the topic when it remained so un-user friendly.

Anyway, go download [Snippy](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=b0813ae7-466a-43c2-b2ad-f87e4ee6bc39) - it'll make your code snippet life a happier and more rewarding one. Hopefully it'll be in the next version of VS inside the box...
