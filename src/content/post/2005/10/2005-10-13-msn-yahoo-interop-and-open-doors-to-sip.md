Well, looks like I made a good [prediction](http://www.woodwardweb.com/technology/000131.html).  According to the [New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8152), MSN and Yahoo are linking their IM products together and opening up their VOIP solutions to SIP.  What's that saying about thy enemy's ememy?  Be interesting to see how this works out in practise but looks like Google are meeting the objectives of Google Talk, without having to release a finished version!  Will also be interesting to see how Skype react.  I wonder if we'll ever see a unified IM system?  I hope so.
