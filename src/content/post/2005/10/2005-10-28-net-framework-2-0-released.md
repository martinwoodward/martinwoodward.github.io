Taking me a little by suprise, the official RTM version of the [.NET Framework 2.0](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx) is now available.  The really good news is that the official version is v2.0.50727 which is exactly the same version of the framework that shipped with Beta 3 of [Visual Studio Team System](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/teamsystem/).  That makes my [VSTSPlugins](http://vstsplugins.sourceforge.net/) project a little easier to keep track of.  Hopefully the "Beta 3 Refresh" of VSTS only involves server side changes - in which case the CruiseControl plugin should be good for a while and I can start proper work on getting Nant upgraded to .NET 2.0.
