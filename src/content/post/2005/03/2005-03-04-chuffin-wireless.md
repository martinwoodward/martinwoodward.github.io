Today I had the pleasure of visiting London for the day. It's always a pleasure to visit London because I am so very grateful that I don't live there. (If you haven't heard the [London Underground](http://www.geofftech.co.uk/adb/january05_files/goingunderground.mp3) song then take a listen - NOT work safe!!)

Anyway, on the way down to London I had my [NetStumbler](http://www.netstumbler.com/) open looking for WiFi links. (Wartraining anyone??) Done this a couple of times and you get amusing results, especially from some of the SID's giving very frank names as to the reason that person has got broadband...

Now, I'm on the 21:00 GNER service from Kingscross to Newcastle and I am sitting in the Buffet Car, connected to the internet wirelessly. Seems to work pretty well. I can access email and internet ok. The latency sucks - just tried to fire up a Skype session with a buddy in the states but that was too much to ask. The fact that you can check your mail for free (if you travel in first class) and surf the web while travelling at 125mph is pretty sweet!
