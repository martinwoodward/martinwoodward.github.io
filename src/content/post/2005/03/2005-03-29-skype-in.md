I just used some spare PayPal money to get myself a 3 month subscription to the SkypeIn Beta. Had trouble finding a free number in the area code of my choice (was going to go for a US number in Silicon Valley, but ended up going for a Chicago one because there were plenty left)

Anyway, feel free to spam my new SkypeIn voicemail box by calling **(+1) 312-239-0607**. You never know, I may be online at the time and surprise you by answering the call.

While I was looking, I found [this](http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1443) blog post on available [SkypeIn US area codes](http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1443). The only UK area code available at the moment is Central London ([0208](http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=530000&y=179000&z=0&sv=530000,179000&st=OSGrid&lu=Y&tl=Approximate%20Location%20of%20Area%20Code%20020%208,%20London&ar=y&bi=~&mapp=newmap.srf&searchp=newsearch.srf)).
