You know, this internet thing might just take off one day.  One of my good buddies, [Clark Sell](http://www.csell.net), has just fired up Wordpress and started blogging.  His first post is a good story that Kevin Rice sent him about how a [company policy begins](http://csell.net/?p=6).  This piece is very true, sadly the original source of this gem is unknown.  

Keep an eye on his blog as he has some interesting TDD techniques with partial classes in C# that sound interesting.  Hopefully he will post them once he has chance to make sure they work.  You can guarantee there will be a picture of one of his beloved cars sooner or later...
