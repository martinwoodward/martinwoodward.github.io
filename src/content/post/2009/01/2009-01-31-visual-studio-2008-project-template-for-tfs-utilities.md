My friend and fellow Team System MVP, [Neno Loje](http://msmvps.com/blogs/vstsblog/), has been on a blogging frenzy this year. Recently he has published a handy [Visual Studio template](http://msmvps.com/blogs/vstsblog/archive/2009/01/14/download-visual-studio-2008-project-template-for-tfs-utilities.aspx) if you do a lot of playing with Team Foundation Server API calls (as I do), or if you are trying to play with an TFS API example that you have found on the net but are having trouble finding the assemblies required to use it.
