[](http://url.ie/11q9) Today is the first day of the new year in the office and so it is time for me to do the dance that I always do after [Auld Lang Syne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne), and that is the Annual Year Planner Shuffle. This morning I threw away the 2008 year planner, moved the 2009 one up and printed out a new 2010 sheer.

While I have my Outlook / Google / Apple iCal calendars all synchronized and duplicated onto my mobile devices, I also love to have a simple year planner printed on a sheet of paper and up on the wall next to my desk for quick reference. I have the current year and the following year on my wall and fill it out with key dates as I know about them. Things like public holidays, conferences, release dates etc. Anything that I would want to know about when taking a quick look out in the future to do some long term planning.

My favourite year planner comes out of (I think) an Adobe Pagemaker template. I don’t have Adobe Pagemaker and so at the start a year I will search for “2010 year planner pmd” or whatever the year happens to be and generally I will find a copy of a PDF that some kind soul has published on the internet. I’ve leached the past few years (since 2007 I think) from some kind person at the University of Wolverhampton.

If you are following my lead and want to fill out a planner for this year then [Mary Jo Foley](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/) has just [published](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1785) a list of all the [Microsoft related events/conferences of 2009](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1785). Many of the items on Mary’s list with the addition [EclipseCon](http://www.eclipsecon.org/), [Eclipse 3.5 Release Milestones](http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?projectid=eclipse#release_milestones) and the [Northern Ireland Public Holidays](http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/employment/bank-public-holidays/) make up most of the key public dates on my planner for 2009.

Happy New Year to everyone. What with Visual Studio Team System 2010 development progressing along with Windows 7 and Eclipse 3.5 it promises to be another interesting and busy year ahead.
