We get so used to the words “Important Security Update” that it is easy to let messages like this one pass you by. However if you have [Team System Web Access](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=136577) ([TSWA](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=136577)) installed – particularly if you have it on a machine that can be accessed over the internet - then you _really want_ to upgrade it to the latest version available here:

[http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=136577](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=136577)

This release includes an important security fix that you want to have installed. It is a full release so you have to uninstall web access and then install this version. A KB article on the issue is due out soon, keep an eye on [Hakan’s blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/hakane/) for more details.
