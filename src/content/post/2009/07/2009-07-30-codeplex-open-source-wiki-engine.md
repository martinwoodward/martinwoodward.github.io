The clever folks over at CodePlex have recently released the code to the sites excellent wiki.  As you would expect from CodePlex team, the code is available as a project on CodePlex at [http://wikiplex.codeplex.com](http://wikiplex.codeplex.com).  Even better news is that the code has been released under the permissive MS-PL open source license.  

Anyone fancy getting it integrated with Sharepoint?
