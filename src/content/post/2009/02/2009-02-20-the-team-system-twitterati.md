[](http://www.platinumbay.com/blogs/dotneticated/archive/2009/02/18/team-system-on-twitter.aspx) Twitter seems to be going mainstream here in the UK.  I know this because my wife asked me about it, so it must be pretty mainstream as I consider her my bellwether on normality. Anyway I’m not convinced that this trend will last (might be amusing to read that back to myself in a few years) but I’ve been [twittering for a while now](http://www.twitter.com/martinwoodward).  Personally, working in an office on my own a long way from my peers and work friends, I find it a good replacement for popping my head over the cube wall or mentioning something while making a cup of tea in the kitchen. It is also like listening in to the background chatter of other people in the office and occasionally joining in a conversation. It’s not something I worry about keeping on top of, just like I wouldn’t record all the office banter and listen back to it in case I missed something.  Now-a-days I tend to keep my blog long form – Twitter is where I would just type something that is in my head that I wanted to share.  

Anyway, Team System MVP, [Steve Andrews](http://www.platinumbay.com/blogs/) has compiled [a list of Team System twitterers](http://www.platinumbay.com/blogs/dotneticated/archive/2009/02/18/team-system-on-twitter.aspx) (the little bird picture here was from [DryIcons](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/09/23/practika-a-free-icon-set/) and then vandalised by me). If you are interested in Team System then you might want to head over to [Steve’s blog post](http://www.platinumbay.com/blogs/dotneticated/archive/2009/02/18/team-system-on-twitter.aspx) and see if you want to follow them.  In case you are interested in over-hearing to my inane chattering then also feel free to [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/martinwoodward). I’m sure that many of my colleagues have wished that it was as easy to mute me as pressing the un-follow button, so if you do follow me and then rapidly un-follow me I promise not to be offended.  In fact, I’d probably un-follow myself.
