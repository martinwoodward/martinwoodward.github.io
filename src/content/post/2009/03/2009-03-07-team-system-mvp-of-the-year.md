This week I have been in Seattle for the [MVP Summit 2009](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/gp/MVPsummit). It has been a busy week chatting with the Team System team and catching up with all my friends from the MVP community around the world.  

I have to admit that, without doubt, my proudest moment of the week (and also the first time I think I have blushed in a while) was when it was announced that I had won the first ever Team System MVP of the Year award.  I am deeply honoured particularly because it was the 100 or so other VSTS MVP’s that made the decision.  As part of my “prize” I got a shiny belt buckle that I’ve been proudly showing off to anyone that will listen.  [Dan Fernandez](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/) and [Brian Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/) were even kind enough to have me on their “[This Week on Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/This+Week+On+Channel+9/This-Week-Martin-Woodward-MVP-Summit-Web-Perf-Show-Off-and-a-VSTS-Pep-Talk/)” show when I popped round to show off my award.  

Take a look at the [This Week on Channel 9 Episode](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/This+Week+On+Channel+9/This-Week-Martin-Woodward-MVP-Summit-Web-Perf-Show-Off-and-a-VSTS-Pep-Talk/), and don’t forget to [subscribe to the show](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/This+Week+On+Channel+9/). When they don’t have me on it is usually a very entertaining 30 minute re-cap of the weeks events in the .NET world.
