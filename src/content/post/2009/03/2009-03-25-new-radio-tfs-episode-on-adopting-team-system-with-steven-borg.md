[](http://www.radiotfs.com/2009/03/25/AdoptingTeamSystemWithStevenBorg.aspx) Earlier this month I spent a very pleasant evening at the beautiful home of [Steven Borg](http://blog.nwcadence.com/) and recorded the chat we had about adopting Team System in the real world for this months episode of [Radio TFS](http://www.radiotfs.com).  

[Steven Borg](http://blog.nwcadence.com/) is the founder of [Northwest Cadence](http://www.nwcadence.com/), a Gold Certified Microsoft Partner focused on Visual Studio Team System.  He was selected as a VSTS MVP in the first round back in 2005, and has been a Team System MVP even since. He’s little ‘a’ agile, and big on understanding what makes successful development teams tick.  If you’re coming out to TechEd, be sure to head out a day early for his pre-con covering 5 ways real companies have gotten the most out of Team System.  Visit his blog at [http://blog.nwcadence.com](http://www.radiotfs.com/ct.ashx?id=bc94d141-9eaf-4283-bc7e-5e330e1af1e4&url=http%3a%2f%2fblog.nwcadence.com) to learn more!
