In my inbox this morning I got news of another new version of the Team Foundation Sidekicks from Attrice.  I recommended these tools to several people during the recent TechEd EMEA event in Berlin and so it is great to new tools being added all the time.     

With this release we conclude support for Visual Studio/TFS 2005 & 2008; from now on any future releases will target VS/TFS 2010. Sidekicks version for 2010 (based on Beta 2 bits) may be expected by the end of 2009.    

The release 2.4 includes a relatively large number of bug fixes as well as couple of new features.    

**Features**         Labels Sidekick: Support filtering by file extension in Labels Comparison window       Code Review Sidekick: Check-in policy violation indication shown next to changesets in a list       Workspace Sidekick: Support ability to save list of found workspaces       **New Users View Sidekick**: Show searchable list of user names and user display names in TFS Valid Users group        

[Team Foundation Sidekicks 2.4 release](http://www.attrice.info/blog/2009/11/12/team-foundation-sidekicks-2-4-release/) – [Attrice](http://www.attrice.info)   

As a reminder, the sidekicks are an excellent and free add-on to Team Foundation Server.  They make up an essential part of my toolkit.  I’m also pleased to see that they are going to be looking into tools for the TFS2010 stack later in the year, bodes well for TF Sidekick support of TFS 2010 soon after release.
