[Grant Holliday](http://blogs.msdn.com/granth/) has an excellent post up on the new [public workspaces feature in TFS 2010](http://blogs.msdn.com/granth/archive/2009/11/08/tfs2010-public-workspaces.aspx), why it was created and how to use it. I’ve spoken with a number of Teamprise customers who will benefit from this feature when we add workspace permissions to the cross-platform client as it seems fairly common to share access to a unix based build server.

The Public Workspaces feature removes this limitation of one user per workspace and allows multiple users to use the same workspace mappings on a single machine. Unlocked workspaces are sometimes also referred to as "Shared workspaces", as they can be shared among multiple people.

It is going to be interesting to me to see how people use this functionality in the real world. There is certainly a potential for some anti-patterns when (mis) using the feature – however the fact that you have to explicitly make a workspace a public workspace should help a lot.
