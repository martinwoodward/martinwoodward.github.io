TFS has a many strengths.  Two of them that I particularly like talking about are it's performance over a wide area network and the strong IDE integration available for both .NET and Java developers (the latter via [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com) of course).  Microsoft have just posted a [new case study with iGate](http://www.microsoft.com/india/CustomerEvidence/details.aspx?casestudyid=636&type=C), one of the top 20 global outsourcing companies which talks about this in depth.  

iGate has been assesed at CMMI Level 5, Six Sigma methodologies and is COBIT, ISO 9001 and ISO 27001 certified.  They have 8 offices in 12 countries and manage global delivery centers in Mexico, Australia, and India. Like most software development organizations, version control is critical infrastructure and they chose TFS to manage software development projects across all platforms.     

*When we implemented Visual Studio Team System, we noticed immediate process improvement through automation. It reduces the administrative burden and reduction in administration efforts leads to significant cost savings of 55 percent.*

iGate chose TFS ahead of tools such as IBM Rational ClearCase, MKS Implementer and CVS.  For more information on why and what benefits they have got from standardizing on a single platform [take a look at the case study](http://www.microsoft.com/india/CustomerEvidence/details.aspx?casestudyid=636&type=C).
