I recently stumbled across a handy [Team Foundation Build screensaver](http://teambuildscreensaver.codeplex.com/) created by Jim Liddell and wanted to share it as it seems very good. For my team build talks I created a [Team Build Wallboard](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/buildwallboard) as a code sample, however Jim has created his own as a WPF based screensaver and it looks very nice.

A few features that I particularly liked: Deployed as a screen saver (.scr) with full configuration options via the screen saver properties Ability to display multiple builds from multiple team projects Nice, clean WPF based vector graphics Multi-monitor support

The code is also pretty clean, and reminds a WPF novice like me how different a true WPF based programming model can be from WinForms. The only issue I had with it is that I had to download the source code and recompile as x86 only against the TFS2008 API’s to get it to run on my main dev machine which is a Vista x64 machine with VSTS2010 Beta 1 installed.

Anyway, the code is [up on CodePlex](http://teambuildscreensaver.codeplex.com/) under the permissive MS-PL license, so I would encourage you to give it a look and give Jim your feedback or even contribute back features that you would like to add.

Notice in the picture above that Jim has a [Build Bunny](http://www.woodwardweb.com/gadgets/000434.html) sat next to his Build Monitor as well - great to see them breeding like, well – you know…
