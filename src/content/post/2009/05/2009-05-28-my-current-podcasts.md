In the days before I worked for [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com), I had a 3 hour, 120 mile commute. Luckily, at that time [a new thing called “podcasting” was starting to take off](http://www.woodwardweb.com/technology/podcasting.html) and so my travels were filled listening to the few podcasts that were available back then. We are talking pretty early in the history of podcasting. Back then [Dave Winer](http://www.scripting.com/) and [Adam Curry](http://www.curry.com/) were still on talking terms. [Rory Blyth](http://www.neopoleon.com/home/default.aspx) was taking over from [Mark Dunn](http://www.dunntraining.com/) as co-host of DotNetRocks with [Carl Franklin](http://www.intellectualhedonism.com/) and shows would be multiple hour epics, occasionally spilling over into .NET technology but with plenty of tangential discussions. Interestingly, I’ve actually been a [DotNetRocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/) listener longer than I have been into podcasts. Back when I strarted listening to the show I had to burn episodes onto a CD-R (sometimes 2) and it was listening to one of these shows that I heard Carl talking about putting the shows into an RSS feed for automatic delivery to an MP3 player. It was then I got my first iPod and my commute was much more enjoyable.

Times have changed. My commute has gone from 3 hours to 3 seconds, however I find I still have plenty of time in the day (when doing chores around the house, or when exercising etc) to listen to an increasing number of podcasts. Recently, [Grant Holiday](http://ozgrant.com/) [tweeted to ask what podcasts people would recommend](http://twitter.com/gholliday/status/1944405364) and as I couldn’t reply with them all in 140 characters I thoughts I would write this post. Below is my list of podcasts that I am currently subscribed to. [Apple Keynotes](http://www.apple.com/podcasts/apple_keynotes/apple_keynotes.xml) – All the Apple announcements the day after the event [Stack Overflow](http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/series/stackoverflow.html) – Jeff and Joel talking about software development and the StackOverflow website with the occasional interesting guest. [Creative Screenwriters Magazine](http://creativescreenwritingmagazine.blogspot.com/) – Interviews with the Screenwriters behind many of the big Holywood films [David Mitchell’s Soapbox](http://www.channelflip.com/category/show/mitchell-show/) – Video monologues from British Comedian David Mitchell [Diggnation](http://diggnation.com/) – Two men, two laptops and several beers [Friday Night Comedy from BBC Radio 4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/fricomedy/) – Topical satire comedy from Radio 4 [gdgt Weekly](http://gdgt.com/) – Peter and Ryan talk about gadgets even though they have both left Engadget and are busy not releasing their next site gdgt [Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/) – Scott Hanselman’s podcast [The History of Microsoft](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/History/) – Channel 9 show going through the Microsoft archives [iPhone Application Programming](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php) – Standford University course on iPhone Application Development with Apple engineers taking the kids through the course. [MacBreak Weekly](http://www.twit.tv/mbw) – Leo Laporte and the gang talking about Mac News if there is any, or speculating about stuff if there isn’t. This is actually my favourite of the TWiT shows. [Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo Film Reviews](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/kermode/) – Wittertainment at it’s best [.NET Rocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/) – The original .NET podcast. Richard and Carl talking about .NET technologies [Peter Day’s World of Business](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/worldbiz) – Peter Day’s insights into the business world [Podcasts for Running](http://feeds.feedburner.com/PodcastsForRunning) – Couch to 5k training program [Radio TFS](http://www.radiotfs.com/) – Mickey, Paul and I talking about Team System occasionally with various special guests [Robert Llewellyn’s Car Pool](http://www.llewtube.com/) – Bobby Llew giving his famous mates an entertaining drive in his Prius [RunAs Radio](http://www.runasradio.com/) – The IT Pro angle from the PWOP gang, with good guests [Security Now](http://www.twit.tv/sn) – Leo Laporte talks to Steve Gibson about security news. Sometime’s Steve’s attitudes to development and computers drives me to shout back at my iPod in frustration, but it still is a great way of keeping on top of what’s happening in the security area. [TED Talks](http://www.ted.com/) – Talks from people cleverer than me about interesting things. Not only that, they are all much better at presenting than I am [The Thirsty Developer](http://thirstydeveloper.com/) – Microsoft evalgelists Dave Bost and Larry Clarkin talking about technologies interesting in the Microsoft space but mostly from an Architecture angle. [This Week in Tech](http://www.twit.tv/twit) – Unedited ramblings of various technology commentators, mostly interesting [This Week On Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/This+Week+On+Channel+9/) – Dan and Brian’s round up of interesting goings on in the Microsoft technology space [Google TechTalks](http://research.google.com/video.html) – Google gets interesting people in to talk and makes many of them available to the public [Windows Weekly](http://twit.tv/ww) – Paul Thurrott commentating on developments in the Microsoft space, focussing on the consumer side [10-4](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/) – Nice short screencasts highlighting areas in Visual Studio 2010 or .NET 4.0

OK, I admit that I have a problem, but still I find that listening to these podcasts helps me keep an idea of what is going on in the technology world in my spare time, but I also find them all genuinely entertaining as well as educational. If you have any that you think I should be listening to then let me know.
