Last week at [TechEd](http://www.msteched.com/) 2009 North America, I had the pleasure of sitting down with [Brian Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/) to discuss [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com) past, present and future. If you have Silverlight installed you can watch the interview or you can [download the video from the TechEd site](http://www.msteched.com/online/view.aspx?tid=8c5c757d-1336-4644-b1b1-b36cc148e6b0).
