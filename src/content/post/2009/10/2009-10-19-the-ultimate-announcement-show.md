Today, Microsoft made some important announcements regarding the future of Visual Studio 2010 along with the availability of Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 and Team Foundation Server 2010 Beta 2.  Paul, Mickey and I were lucky enough to grab a few minutes to record a show with Doug Seven, Product Manager with Visual Studio, where he took us through the announcements and we got chance to quiz him on some of the details.
