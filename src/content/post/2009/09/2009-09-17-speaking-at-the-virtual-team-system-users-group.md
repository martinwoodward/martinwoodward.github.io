**Build Automation in TFS 2010  
**In this session, Team System MVP Martin Woodward takes us through the radically improved team build features in TFS 2010 Beta 1. You will learn all about the new private builds, gated check-ins and most importantly take a look at the new Windows Workflow based build system. Finally we will talk about protecting your investment in TFS2008 build automation and discuss what the TFS2010 build automation experience will be like for Visual Studio 2008 developers.
