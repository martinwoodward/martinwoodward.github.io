[](http://www.saasmadeeasy.com/Pages/default.aspx) Fellow MVP [Paul Hacker](http://phacker.wordpress.com/) just dropped me a line to share a great offer [his company](http://www.saasmadeeasy.com/) is making available for [BizSpark](http://www.microsoft.com/Bizspark/Default.aspx) companies.  For companies that are in the BizSpark program you can get a hassle free, hosted Team Foundation Server service as a substantial discount (currently $10 per month, per user).  

[Microsoft BizSpark](http://www.microsoft.com/Bizspark/Default.aspx) is a global program designed to help accelerate the success of entrepreneurs and early stage startups. In addition to a fabulous software offer, BizSpark also provides professional support from Microsoft technical experts and other resources.  BizSpark is open to privately held businesses in operation for less than 3 years with less than 1 million USD annual revenue.  

The [SaaS Made Easy](http://www.saasmadeeasy.com/) offer makes it very simple and cost effective to have your team working in TFS from day one. Another advantage of it being a hosted service is that it makes it well suited to a geographically dispersed virtual team.  

For more information on the [offer](http://secure.saasmadeeasy.com/Web/BizSpark/Pages/default.aspx), and links to the BizSpark program head over to the [SaaS Made Easy web site](http://secure.saasmadeeasy.com/Web/BizSpark/Pages/default.aspx).
