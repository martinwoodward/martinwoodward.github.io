[](http://www.radiotfs.com/) [Paul Hacker](http://phacker.wordpress.com/), [Mickey Gousset](http://teamsystemrocks.com/blogs/mickey_gousset/) and I have recently started a [Team System related podcast](http://www.radiotfs.com/) called [Radio TFS](http://www.radiotfs.com/).

While it is not going to win any awards any time soon, we've been having a lot of fun so we are going to continue to try and get one or two episodes out a month. If you have 40 or so minutes to kill, then feel free to [take a listen](http://www.radiotfs.com/ct.ashx?id=ecb4b81c-5a56-4c34-b572-9286ad9710fc&url=http%3a%2f%2ffeeds.feedburner.com%2f%7er%2fradiotfs%2f%7e5%2f245499779%2fradiotfs_003.mp3) and [subscribe](http://feeds.feedburner.com/radiotfs).

If you have any suggestions for topic or any questions about Team System that you would like answered then please drop us a line at [radiotfs@gmail.com](mailto:radiotfs@gmail.com) or visit the website at [http://www.radiotfs.com](http://www.radiotfs.com).
