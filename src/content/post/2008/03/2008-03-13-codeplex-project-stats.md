The fantastic team at [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/) have just rolled out yet another great feature - this time it is statistics for your CodePlex project.  I dropped by my TFS [Plug-in for CruiseControl.NET](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSCCNetPlugin) to take a look...  

[](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSCCNetPlugin/stats/view)   

The project is currently averaging over 12 downloads a day and has had nearly 5000 downloads since I moved it to CodePlex in August 2006.  Not bad for a chunk of code I originally wrote on a plane..  

This is incredibly motivating as a maintainer of an Open Source project.  I've been knowing that I need to give the CC.NET integration some love as there are a few issues and things that I need to address from the excellent feedback I have been receiving.  However - seeing how many people are still interested in the plug-in despite the excellent CI functionality in the 2008 release of TFS has made me realise that I need to get on this ASAP.  Thanks CodePlex!
