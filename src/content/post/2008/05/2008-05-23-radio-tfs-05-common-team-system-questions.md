[](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/radiotfs/~5/296872926/radiotfs_005.mp3) I've just posted the latest installment of Radio TFS.  I'm actually a show behind on editing so expect to see episode 6 up soon.  However, in episode 5 Paul, Mickey and I attempt to answer some of the common questions we hear people ask about Team System including:  What is Team System?  Which edition is right for me?  Why can't I find Team Foundation Server on MSDN?  What is Team Foundation Server Workgroup Edition?  Is VSTS 2005 compatible with TFS 2008?  Why can't I see Team Foundation Server when I install Team Suite?  What are my options for migrating from my old system(s) to TFS?  Can I use TFS with VB6, .NET 1.1, Eclipse etc?  What is a Team Project - how should it be scoped?  I deleted a file locally, I do a "Get Latest" and TFS doesn't download it - why? 

As well as the usual sprinkling of tangents along the way.
