[](http://www.infragistics.com/Default.aspx)Infragistics is the world's largest publisher of reusable presentation layer development tools for Windows Forms, ASP.NET, WPF, Tablet PC and Java (JSF) environments. I think they can count most of the Fortune 2000 as customers of theirs. They also happen to be a customer of ours.

I was in an email discussion with fellow MVP [Ed Blankenship](http://www.edsquared.com/), when he came out with the following quote which Infragistics have kindly given me permission to share.

“We completely use Microsoft® Team Foundation Server (with [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com)) for the development of all of our products now. This was especially challenging with bringing in our Java (JSF) development group into the same development process of our .NET product lines. By leveraging the [Teamprise Eclipse plug-in](http://www.teamprise.com/products/plugin/) and the [ANT Team Build tasks](http://www.teamprise.com/products/build/), we were able to ensure they were using the exact same systems as the other departments in Engineering. So the JSF team now has access to the same build, version control, work item tracking, and other internal automated software solutions that the rest of our company uses. Visual Studio® Team System has really enabled us to solidify our internal ALM process, metrics gathering, and reduce overhead from supporting different systems across product teams.”

Thanks for sharing Ed! On a personal note, I'm glad that the Ant integration is proving so useful to many companies and this is an area that we are going to continue investing in along with everything else.
