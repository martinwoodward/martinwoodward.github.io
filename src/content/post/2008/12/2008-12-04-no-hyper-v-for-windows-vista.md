When I saw the news about the upcoming Windows Vista SP2, there was a little note right down at the bottom that got me quite excited.

"Windows Vista SP2 includes Hyper-Vâ„¢ technology, enabling full virtualization of server workloads"

I know a lot of people that run Windows Server 2008 on their laptops, specifically so that they can run Hyper-V virtual machines rather than using the much inferior Virtual PC 2007 - so this looked like exciting news.  This point was carried on through as news about the Service Pack Beta spread (see [Mary-Jo Foley](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1745), [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/5101130/windows-vista-sp2-features-and-fixes-unveiled-beta-announced)) among others.

Microsoft have since [clarified the position](http://blogs.technet.com/springboard/archive/2008/12/02/windows-vista-sp2-what-s-inside-what-s-important.aspx).  SP2 does not add Hyper-V capabilities to Windows Vista SP2.  The confusion all comes from the fact that the SP2 is actually a service pack to both Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 - which goes to show how similar the two code bases are now.  There is a good explanation over at [Springboard](http://blogs.technet.com/springboard/archive/2008/12/02/windows-vista-sp2-what-s-inside-what-s-important.aspx).

I wanted to post this here because I'd seen the announcement from Microsoft and mis-understood exactly what SP2 was providing and I know of others that were equally confused.  Luckily Microsoft virtualization guru [Brian Randell](http://mcwtech.com/CS/blogs/brianr/) corrected my understanding - but not everyone is lucky enough to have a Brian Randell in their pocket so I thought I would share the clarification :-)

It is also very interesting to see how excited people were when they thought that Hyper-V was coming to Vista - I hope once the fuss of the confusing press release has settled down, Microsoft take note.
