[](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/) [Brian Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/) (of [This Week on Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/This+Week+On+Channel+9/) fame) has [just announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/archive/2008/12/17/announcing-10-4.aspx) a new weekly show on Channel 9 called [10-4](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/) where you can learn about what's coming in Visual Studio 2010 and the .NET Framework 4.0.  

[http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/)  

Each week, Brian promises to drag in various technical evangelists from the teams including Drew Robbins, Jonathan Carter and Jason Olson to help you learn more about what's coming in Visual Studio 2010 and the .NET Framework 4.0.  

Be sure to subscribe to the RSS feed to catch new shows each week. I have the [iPod version](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/feed/ipod/) subscribed in iTunes right now which will hopefully allow me to keep up with all the new information about the next release of Visual Studio and the .NET Framework in bite sized chunks.
