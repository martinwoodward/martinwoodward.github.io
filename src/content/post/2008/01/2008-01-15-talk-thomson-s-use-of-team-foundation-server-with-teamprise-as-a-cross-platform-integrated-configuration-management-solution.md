I just noticed that on Wednesday January 16th at 5pm, the [Minnesota Visual Studio Team System User Group](http://vstsmn.net/) are having a [talk](http://team-foundation-server.blogspot.com/2008/01/vsts-meeting-on-wednesday-january-16th.html) by [Mac Noland](http://team-foundation-server.blogspot.com/).

Mac is a good guy with some very interesting real-life experience in the use of TFS, and I would expect this talk from Mac to give people a great understanding of TFS could fit in their enterprise - but also a realistic, unbiased, warts and all view of TFS with Teamprise in the real world.

Should be fun - I wish I was closer as I would love to attend myself. If you are in the area and can make it along, then here are the details:-

**Topic: **Thomson's use of Team Foundation Server with Teamprise as a cross platform, integrated Configuration Management solution.

**Description:**

Thomson's Online Services is responsible for the backend storage and retrieval of online assets. The Online Services - Quality department has implemented Team Foundation Server (TFS) for the group, which primarily develops in Java on Windows, Linux, Linux64, Unix and Mac. With the help of Teamprise, Online Services is now able to interact with their configuration management solution (i.e. TFS) from non-Windows environments.

Online Services has learned some valuable "cross platform" lessons while implementing TFS. These lessons may benefit others as they start to implement TFS for non-Microsoft development groups. A sampling of their experience is below. Yes, you can use TFS to store non-Microsoft software assets Replace multiple bug, change, source management tools with TFS Use Team Build for non-Microsoft builds
