[Brian Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/) has [posted](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/archive/2008/01/18/my-virtual-teched-interview-with-brian-harry.aspx) a [great interview](http://www.virtualteched.com/Videos/SA_1_bkeller_FINAL_500k.wmv) with [Brian Harry](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/) about Visual Studio Team System 2008, and a lot of detail on the improvements in Team Foundation Server 2008.  One of the things that I enjoy about talking with [Brian Harry](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/) is that you get the information in a direct and clear way, with a complete absence of "marketing speak" or buzzword bingo.  At just over 10 minutes in length, [this interview](http://www.virtualteched.com/Videos/SA_1_bkeller_FINAL_500k.wmv) is a classic example of that and is densely packed with information - highly recommended.
