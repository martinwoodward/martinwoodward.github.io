[](http://www.microsoftpdc.com) In case you hadn't heard, this week is [Microsoft PDC 2008](http://microsoftpdc.com/) in LA. Sadly I'm not able to make it over this time due to some health issues, however the [Teamprise](http://www.teamprise.com) team will be out in full force. We have quite a few new things to show people this week including: Integration with TFS 2010 Publishing JUnit test results into TFS (2005, 2008 and 2010) A brand new product!!

So if you happen to be at PDC then please stop by the Teamprise booth at the Partner Expo. Also, [Brian the Build Bunny](http://www.woodwardweb.com/gadgets/000434.html) will be making an appearance at the [ShowOff](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/Social/Contest/ShowOff.aspx) event tonight so if you are a fan of [Brian's work](http://www.woodwardweb.com/gadgets/000434.html), then stop by and give him some votes.

If, like me, you are stuck back at the office wishing you'd managed to get out to PDC then don't forget to keep an eye on [my blog](http://www.woodwardweb.com/) for Teamprise news through the week and on the [Microsoft PDC site](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/) to follow the conference virtually.
