[](http://blogs.msdn.com/gertd/) Over on [Radio TFS](http://www.radiotfs.com/) we've just published a [special episode on the Database Edition of Team System](http://www.radiotfs.com/2008/08/21/RadioTFS09VisualStudioTeamSystem2008DatabaseEdition.aspx) with the man himself, [Gert Drapers](http://blogs.msdn.com/gertd/).  In the show Gert brings us up to speed on how the product got started, where it is now and where it is going in the future.  We also spent a lot of time talking about the [latest CTP](http://blogs.msdn.com/gertd/archive/2008/08/20/vstsdb-2008-gdr-ctp16-is-here.aspx) ([released last night](http://blogs.msdn.com/gertd/archive/2008/08/20/vstsdb-2008-gdr-ctp16-is-here.aspx)) of the Database Edition GDR along with a few exclusive bits of information that I'd not heard elsewhere before.  

As well as [listening to the show](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/radiotfs/~5/370782376/radiotfs_009.mp3), be sure to check out [Gert's blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/gertd/archive/2008/08/20/vstsdb-2008-gdr-ctp16-is-here.aspx) for more details.
