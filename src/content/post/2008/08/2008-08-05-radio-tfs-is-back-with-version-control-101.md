[](http://www.radiotfs.com/) In this [first episode back from the summer break](http://www.radiotfs.com/2008/08/05/RadioTFS08BasicsOfTFSVersionControl.aspx) we talk about the features available in TFS Version Control and talk about some of the fundamental concepts that you should understand to make your life easier.  Don't forget to stay tuned all the way to the end when I offer up a brainteaser for everyone and Paul goes crazy and offers a FULL copy of Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Team Suite to a lucky listener drawn at random who provides a correct answer to [radiotfs@gmail.com](mailto:radiotfs@gmail.com) before the end of August 2008.  

If that is not enough for you, Mickey is [running a competition over at Team System Rocks](http://shrinkster.com/10wz) where you could win a years MSDN Premium Subscription with Visual Studio Team Suite.
