Many people know that Team System and Team Foundation Server are incredibly extensible platforms.  [Mike Azocar](http://www.michaelazocar.com/) (a fellow Team System MVP) has come up with a great idea to see up can come up with the [coolest Team System add-on](http://www.michaelazocar.com/blog/?p=485).  If you have an idea that you've been waiting on trying out then now might be a good time as you get the chance to win a one year [Team Suite MSDN Subscription](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/subscriptions/bb841434.aspx) (worth over $10,000) among other valuable prizes and the exposure for your gadget on most of the world's leading Team System blogs.  

Because I doubt I'm going to be able to do better than my [robot rabbit TFS add-on](http://www.woodwardweb.com/gadgets/000434.html), I'm going to help judge the competition.  I am really looking forward to seeing what folks can come up with.  

For more information, see [Mike's blog post](http://www.michaelazocar.com/blog/?p=485).  Happy coding!
