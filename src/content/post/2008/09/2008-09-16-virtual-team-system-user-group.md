[](http://www.tsug-ve.com/)  

Chewing Glas (aka [Paul Hacker](http://phacker.wordpress.com/)) and Daven Finesmith (aka [Dave McKinstry](http://weblogs.asp.net/dmckinstry)) are proud to announce a new users group, the Team System User Group - Virtual Edition.  The user group will use Live Meeting for demos and talks, holding the social side of the user group meeting (let's face it often the best part) over in Second Life.  

By doing this virtually, not only will it enable people from all around the world to take part - they will also be able to bring in some world class speakers very easily.  Best of all you'll get to join in for free.  

Initially the meetings will be in English with a US friendly time, but they are hoping to extend the group to other languages and times as things progress.  

If you are interested, visit the web site:  [http://www.tsug-ve.com/](http://www.tsug-ve.com/)  Sign-up and theyâ€™ll contact you with additional meeting information.  The first meeting is on Thursday 18th September at 6pm PST (yes even virtual user groups meet on a Thursday night).
