[](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=373) The other week [Brian Randall](http://www.mcwtech.com/cs/blogs/brianr) and I sat down with Carl and Richard [to record a .Net Rocks episode](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=373).  Honestly, you wait years for a Brian Randall podcast and then [three](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=373) [come](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=359) [along](http://www.runasradio.com/default.aspx?showNum=69) at once!  

In this episode we talked about what's been happening in the Team System world since 2005, share some best practice war stories and look forward to some the new goodies coming up in the next release.  You can get the episode [here](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=373).  

Don't forget that if you like listening to podcasts about Team System and Team Foundation Server, then hopefully you'll love [Radio TFS](http://www.radiotfs.com/) :-)
