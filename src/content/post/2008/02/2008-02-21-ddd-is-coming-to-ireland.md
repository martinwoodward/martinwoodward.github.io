[](http://www.dddireland.com/) Developer Developer Developer is coming to the beautiful west of Ireland in May with [GAMTUG](http://gamtug.spaces.live.com/) hosting the event on Saturday May 3rd. If you are in or around Ireland at that time then I would encourage you sign up. My good friend, and fellow Team System MVP, [Mike Azocar](http://www.michaelazocar.com/blog/) will be doing a session on Scrum which should be well worth sitting in on.

There will be no Microsoft speakers presenting, just speakers from the .NET developer community, although I hear our local friendly Platform Evangelists (DPEs) will be on hand to help out and chat to everyone and to take in the atmosphere.

The day promises to be a great learning experience, but also a fantastic way to meet like-minded people - if anything else, you get a trip to the lovely [Galway](http://www.ebookireland.com/galway.htm) which is never a wasted journey.
