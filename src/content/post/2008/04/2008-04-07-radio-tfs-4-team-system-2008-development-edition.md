I've just posted the [fourth episode](http://www.radiotfs.com/2008/04/01/RadioTFS04VisualStudioTeamSystem2008DevelopmentEdition.aspx) of [Radio TFS](http://www.radiotfs.com/). In this episode Paul and Mickey talk about Visual Studio Team System 2008 Development Edition while I ask dumb questions and go off on tangents. Despite this, it is actually one of our better episodes to date. So if you are interested and have a spare 35 minutes during a commute or something then please take a listen and [let us know what you think](mailto:radiotfs@gmail.com).
