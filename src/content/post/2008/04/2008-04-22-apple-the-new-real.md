[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/AppleTheNewReal_99C1/Apple%20Software%20Update_2.png) <rant>Sigh.  Apple are really starting to get on my nerves.  Not only is iTunes on Windows consistently very buggy, slow and foreign looking in the Windows OS - they are now trying to trick Windows users into installing Safari.  On this particular machine I have never installed Safari, and I never want to.  At first I thought the offering of Safari via Apple Update (as a default option) was just a mistake, I figured out how to tell the installer to ignore the update and moved on.  The second time I gave them the benefit of the doubt - but here they are again.  Today I got the following fantastic message from Apple Update.  "WhichDescription()" indeed.  Gives you a wonderful feeling that they've spent a lot of time on this one.  So from today - Apple update is now disabled on my machine and will stay that way until Apple trick me into switching it back on again. 

This is incredibly bad form and reminds me of all the rubbish that Real software used to get up to when they were still relevant.  The worse thing is that it will condition people to disable updaters when we live in a time that I would prefer people kept their systems up to date and patched.  I know that people will have said this in other places and in better ways - but if Microsoft pulled this sort of trick, just imagine the reaction.  This kind of move feels like one of desperation or arrogance - possibly both.</rant> 

Apologies for the rant - normally I keep this sort of thing off my blog but this one really annoyed me.
