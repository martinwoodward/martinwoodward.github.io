Thanks to everyone who attended my session this afternoon at IMTC 2008 in Dublin.  As promised, here is a copy of the slide deck.    [Automating Builds with Team Foundation Server 2008 (pdf - 1.26 MB)](http://www.woodwardweb.com/talks/imtc2008.pdf) 

Also, as mentioned - the Build Wallboard project that we did as a demo is also available at the MSDN Code Gallery here:
