Nightmare.  Just done a search on [Google](http://www.google.com) for [Martin Woodward](http://www.woodwardweb.com) and I no longer appear!   My pagerank has just totally dissapeared!  I still have a 5/10 ranking in the google toolbar but [Martin Woodward](http://www.woodwardweb.com) no longer works - [try for yourself](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Martin+Woodward).  Could this be a result of my latest re-design?  I'm absolutely gutted. If you know me, can you please put a link to my homepage like this:-

<A HREF="http://www.woodwardweb.com">Martin Woodward</A>

**Update:**  I've found myself - on page 2.  Nightmare...  What has the web come to.

**Update (1st October): ** At last, I have made it back onto the first page (even if I am the last entry).  Only 9 more places to go and then [I'll feel lucky](http://www.google.co.uk/help/features.html#lucky)
