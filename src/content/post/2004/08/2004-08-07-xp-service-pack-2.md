So, took the plunge and installed XP Service Pack 2 today.  Wanted to see if the changes to Internet Explorer did anything strange to website I have designed, but also if the Service Pack would work on my HP Compaq nx7010.  So far so good, having a few intermittent problems with my WiFi, but everything else seems to work.

**Update:** WiFi working now.  Looked like a problem with the WPA fix in SP2.
