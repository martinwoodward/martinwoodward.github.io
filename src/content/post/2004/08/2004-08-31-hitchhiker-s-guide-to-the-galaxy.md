Fantastic news.  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is set to be extended this year with [new editions of the radio series](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/newseries.shtml) and also (finally) the [movie](http://hitchhikers.movies.go.com/) that Douglas Adams tried so long and hard to get made.

**Update: 24/9/2004** Just listened to the first of the new radio series and it is superb.  I was worried when I heard they were going to be doing a new one, but it seems to be working out brilliantly.  I've listened to the old series so many times I'd forgotten how funny and fresh Hitchhiker is.
