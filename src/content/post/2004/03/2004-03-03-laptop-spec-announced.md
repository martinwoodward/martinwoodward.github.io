[](http://www.hpstore.hp.co.uk/itemDetails?sku=DJ342T)The spec of my free laptop has been announced.  It is a [HP nx7010](http://www.hpstore.hp.co.uk/itemDetails?sku=DJ342T) Centrino.  Best bit if the 15.4" 16:10 WXGA display.  Might need to upgrade the memory but apart from that it is a pretty good machine - very good for the price!  They are being ordered on Friday so I may have it next week.
