The first commercial [E-Ink](http://www.eink.com/) product is about to hit the market in Japan.  [According to the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3568505.stm) the Sony LIBRIe 1000-EP will cost around 200GBP and be available in April.  

While this is the first version of the technology, it looks like it may well take off.  If the screen is as good as it sounds, the propect of weighing your holiday bags down with paper-backs may well be coming to an end...
