BBC Four recently broadcast an interesting documentary [Tetris: From Russia With Love](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/tetris.shtml) which was a very interesting account of the battles behind this simple but addictive game set against the backdrop of Cold War tensions.  Rupert Murdoch's access into the Russian political system is also highlighted.

Anyway, [an article on the Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/36270.html) has highlighted [Thomas Reed's](http://www.af.mil/bios/bio.asp?bioID=6865) book [At The Abyss](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0891418210/woodwardwebcom) which looks well worth a read.
