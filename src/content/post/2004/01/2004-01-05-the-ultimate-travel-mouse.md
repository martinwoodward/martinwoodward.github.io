Just seen this mouse - the [Labtec Mini Optical Mouse](http://www.pcworld.co.uk/product.php?sku=930715) - in action and it really looks like a fantastic mouse for the road warrior.

It's optical (i.e. no mouse mat or de-fluffing required) and cordless with a unique design with its USB stored inside the mouse when not in use. When you're ready to start working, just pop out the receiver, plug it in, and start mousing. Later, when receiver is stored this turns off the mouse, extending battery life. 

It is also nice and compact, but still big enough for the average hand.   Currently about Â£30 from [PC World](http://www.pcworld.co.uk/product.php?sku=930715) - might see some of my Christmas money.
