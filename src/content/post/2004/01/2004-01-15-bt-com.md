[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/blogimages/btcom.html)Worked in the Central Architecture Team for the [BT.com](http://www.bt.com) project, looking after the re-design of the Faut, Orders, Inventory, Tracking (FOIT) module. This was a BEA Weblogic Portal 7 project.

Best bit about this project was working with the folks from BEA, where I made some lifelong friends while learning a lot from them.
