[The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk) have published the results of an important benchmark test - what is the best [free rucksack](http://go.theregister.com/feed/2004/11/18/rucksacks_evaluation/). No matter how boring the presentation, everyones eyes always light up when the contents of the marketing cupboard are raided.

A simple but particular favourite of mine is my rather solid [BEA](http://www.bea.com) pen - much better than the pack of crayons or USB power laptop light. I know many a [BEA](http://www.bea.com) consultant who are fond of their watches. Sometimes I wonder what normal people place under their mice and where they get mouse mats from. Their are plenty of alternative uses for CD's (any probably a few websites devoted to the topic) but I don't know any other uses for mouse mats - so mine live in the back of dark drawers, hibernating.

My [Interwoven](http://www.interwoven.com/) pen-knife got me in a bit of bother when casually left it in my laptop bag and then tried to get on a plane. Clothing is always a favourite. Because I am of a somewhat unusal physique I have never been given a freebie that I can actually fit in to. To take revenge I get great pleasure in giving reps clothing belong to that of their competitors and make them wear it.

While not strictly manufacturers free crap, the best freebies of all have to be the wash bags and pyjamas you get in First Class on [BA](http://www.ba.com) flights. They make great Christmas presents.
