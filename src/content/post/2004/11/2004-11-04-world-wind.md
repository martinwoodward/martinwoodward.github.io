[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/moblog/world_wind.html)So, how about a desktop application that allows you to zoom in to any part of the world, move around and view in 3D? How about the appliation coming from NASA, which means you have a NASA directory in your Program Files, and a cool NASA icon on your desktop? How about the application in question being Open Source and written in C#?

If like me you think this is really cool, then download [World Wind](http://learn.arc.nasa.gov/worldwind/) from NASA. The project is in [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nasa-exp/) if you also would like to help. The software is really cool. Works a treat! Unfortuneately the server seems quite busy and you get lots of errors saying so, however when it is working it is soo worth it. The picture here is of my journey to work, nice... I can virtually fly to work in less than a second...
