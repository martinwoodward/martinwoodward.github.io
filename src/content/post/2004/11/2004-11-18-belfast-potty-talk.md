Fantastic news.  Belfast is to host the [2005 World Toilet Summit](http://www.cleanpoint.com/articles/news_article.asp?news_unique_id=10557), very near to where I work.

According to Cleanpoint.com:-  *Hosted by The British Toilet Association, the Summit is being supported by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, Belfast City Council, the International Fund for Ireland and Belfast Visitor Convention Bureau, along with The World Toilet Organisation (WTO). *

*BTA Director Richard Chisnell told CHT: "We are busy planning a memorable four days for delegates"*

Sounds to me like they plan to go on the p**s and talk crap...
