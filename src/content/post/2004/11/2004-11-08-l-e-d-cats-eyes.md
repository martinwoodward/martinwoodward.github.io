As I may have mentioned to anyone that will listen to me - I am currently getting up at a daft time of the morning to beat the traffic into work.  On my journeys I have noticed a completely new invention that I have never noticed before but one that is such a good idea.  

On certain high speed bends on the un-lit road, there are now LED Cats Eyes lighting the way.  I first noticed them when I was coming out of a junction and looked to my left to see the cats eyes were lit even though my headlights were not on them.  They had a slight stobe to them bit were perfectly clear lighting the road ahead.  What a great idea, just an incremental improvement on [Percy Shaw](http://www.design-technology.info/inventors/page14.htm)'s original idea, but what a good one.  

Found a bit more about them at a company called [Relfecto](http://reflecto.co.uk/products_active.html), along with some interesting toys...
