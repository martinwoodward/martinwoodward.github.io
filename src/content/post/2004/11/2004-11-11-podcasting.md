I've recently come across Podcasting (or blogcasting as it is sometimes called).  Basically it makes use of a feature in the [RSS spec](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss) called [enclosure](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt) that allows links to downloadable content - in this case audio content.  Tools such as [ipodder](http://www.ipodder.org/) have come out that  allow a user to have the contents of the RSS feeds downloaded to their hard-drive for offline listening.  Combine this with syncronisation with your [iPod](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002OXOZM/woodwardwebcom) or other MP3 player and you have the ability for automated pushing of subscribed audio feeds to your MP3 player for listening to at your convienience.

Though podcasting is a fairly new trend (<[2 months old](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ipodder-dev/message/41)), it is certainly getting a lot of media attention, with articles in [Wired](http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,65237,00.html) and [Internet News](http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3431901).   Wonder how long before the BBC and the Guardian run a story?

My first podcast subscription?  [DotNetRocks](http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks/), an online talk show for .Net developers.  You would expect nothing less ;-)

**Update:**  While checking the derivation of the term, I found [this article in the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1145689,00.html) from Feb 2004.  Looks like they were ahead of the game again.
