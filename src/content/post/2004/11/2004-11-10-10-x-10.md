[](http://www.tenbyten.org/)Ten by Ten is a new interesting project to capture the words and images that are making the news every hour of every day. The top 100 word and images are placed in a 10 x 10 grid for you to browse. The site has been produced in a [developer](http://www.tenbyten.org/developers.html) friendly fashion so the possibility of site plugins is a possibility I may investigate. Worth five minutes of your time at any rate, plus it is an interesting experiment in information architecture.
