Good post on [Paul Vick](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/)'s blog about the characteristics of [Black Hole projects](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2004/12/01/2598.aspx) at M$.  This got me thinking about some traits I recognise:-The goal of the system cannot be summed up in a sentanceThey involve more people than you can fit on a busThey must have completely unrealistic deadlines.

Alternatively, they have deadlines more than 9 months away.
