[](http://www.woodwardweb.com/images/blog/1954Popularmechanics.html)Got forwarded this today, apparently from a 1954 Popular Mechanics magazine.

"...how a 'home computer' could look like in the year 2004. With teletype interface and the Fortran language, the computer will be easy to use."

I thought that the image looked a bit suspicious, the paper was a bit funny at the bottom of the teletype. One quick search on google later and an interesting story emerges...
