Recently discovered these excellent [UML 2.0 Stencils and Templates](http://www.phruby.com/stencildownload.html) for Visio by Pavel Hruby.  

While I am still waiting for my ideal UML drawing tool, I keep coming back to [Visio](http://r.office.microsoft.com/r/rlidAppFolder?clid=1033&p1=visio).  It is much better than [Rose](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/rational/) and better performing than [Poseidon](http://www.gentleware.com/) (you also don't get that daft fish dude in the background as you do with [Poseidon](http://www.gentleware.com/) exports).

With [IBM's UML 2.0 article](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/3101.html) and the book [UML 2 For Dummies](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764526146/woodwardwebcom), I can express what I want to without getting to bogged down in implmentation detail too early, yet I can give that level of detail when I need to.  My only problem is when I turn up on customer sites having been sold as an Architect and I have a copy of [UML 2 For Dummies](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764526146/woodwardwebcom) under my arm.  At least I am setting expectations early...
