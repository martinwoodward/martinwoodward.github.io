Just watched SpaceShipOne go into space for the first of its [X-prize](http://www.xprize.org/) runs.  Looked like a natsy spin at the towards the end of the rocket firing but it seems to have sucessfully crossed the boundary into space and is now gliding back to Mojave Spaceport in California (sporting its fancy new [Virgin](http://www.virgingalactic.com/) logo).

**Update:**  According to [BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3706330.stm), the spin may have been caused by the pilot, Mike Melvill, accidentally pressing on a pedal during the rocket burn.  Cool
