Just installed [Pocket SharpMT](http://www.randyrants.com/rr/sharpmt.asp) on my HP4150 (what is rapidly becoming my favourite gadget). So far it seems pretty fully featured. In fact I think some aspects are easier to use than the [full version](http://www.randyrants.com/rr/sharpmt.asp). However my handwriting needs to get a lot better if I want to use it in anger. Either that or I need to buy a keyboard...
