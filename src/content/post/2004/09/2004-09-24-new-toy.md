[](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000139HAA/woodwardwebcom)I've just treated myself to a new toy. A brand new [HP4150](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000139HAA/woodwardwebcom) PDA. After much looking, the cheapest place seemed to be [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000139HAA/woodwardwebcom).

Been very happy with it so far. Has both Bluetooth and WiFi. [WiFiFoFum](http://www.wififofum.org/) is an excellent WiFi sniffer, the [radar screen](/images/wififofum.GIF) impresses everyone I have shown it to. Got Terminal Services, [GnuPG](http://www.gnupg.org/), [VNC](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~midgley/wince/vnc.html), SSH and a console installed so I can do most debugging I need to. All I need now is a serial cable so I can TIP into sun boxes and I have a cool bit of portable kit for getting machines working.

It can store phone numbers, check my email and play a wicked game of solitaire as well...
