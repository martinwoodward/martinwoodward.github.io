Took this picture from my [phone](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000C8RAY/woodwardwebcom) ([Sony Erricson T610](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000C8RAY/woodwardwebcom)).  The camera is pretty poor, however nice picture of the base of a lampost on the [Queen's Bridge in Belfast](http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=54.6&lon=-5.9216&scale=5000&icon=x).  In the background is the [Waterfront](http://www.waterfront.co.uk/homepage.asp) concert hall and you might just be able to make out my office.
