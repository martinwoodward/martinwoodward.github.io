Been wondering what to do with all those GMail invites? Well thanks to a couple of new developments you can now mount a gmail account as an external file system.

First up, for lovers of penguins we have [GmailFS](http://richard.jones.name/google-hacks/gmail-filesystem/gmail-filesystem.html) a mountable filesystem for linux. It is a Python application, using the [FUSE](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse/) filesystem infrastructure to help provide the filesystem, and [libgmail](http://libgmail.sourceforge.net/) to communicate with Gmail. GmailFS supports most file operations such as read, write, open, close, stat, symlink, link, unlink, truncate and rename.

Next we have the [GMail Drive](http://www.viksoe.dk/code/gmail.htm), a shell extension for windows. GMail Drive enables you to save and retrieve files stored on your GMail account directly from inside Windows Explorer. GMail Drive adds a new drive to your computer under the My Computer folder.

[xdrive](http://www.freedrive.com/) is dead, long live gmail (so long as you don't worry about the privacy of the files stored...)
