The [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk) have rather quietly released a new version of their website, with related links powered by their [Newstraker](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/3676692.stm) system. This appears to automate the production of links to external news sites.

According to the [BBC Story](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/3676692.stm) this is in reaction to users comments that:-

Our users tell us that one of the things they value most about our service is our policy of linking openly to other websites.

That as may be but you can't help thinking it may be a reaction to the [recent report](http://www.culture.gov.uk/global/publications/archive_2004/BBC_Online_Review.htm) from the [Department for culture, media and sport](http://www.culture.gov.uk/). At a time when the BBC is positioning ahead of its license renewal they want to be seen as positively not competing with commercial companies. Featuring links to commercial news sites helps argue their case.

Personally, if it makes the [BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk) site better I'm all for it. As far as I am concerned the license fee is the best value of all my "information" subscriptions (GBP 30 pcm for broadband, GBP 30pcm for Sky+, phone bills etc). I just wish they would drop their habbit of publishing technology articles that are little more than a re-worded press release advertising some companies product.
