Doing a big peice of UI design again at the moment. While avoiding writing documentation, found a couple of books that are pretty good, however the titles will certainly not help improve my wife's opinion of my job.

First up with have [Designing with Web Standards](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712018/woodwardwebcom) by Jeffrey Zeldman. This is rapidly becoming a standard text on the subject like [Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/156205810X/woodwardwebcom) by Jakob Nielsen. However, unlike Nielsen's book [Designing with Web Standards](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712018/woodwardwebcom) is well laid out, up to date and an interesting read.

Next up is [Defensive Design for the Web](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/073571410X/woodwardwebcom) or to give the book its full title; "Defensive Design for the Web: How to Improve Error Messages, Help, Forms, and Other Online Crisis Points" - proof positive that search engines are ruing the art of a good title. Despite the rather uninspiring title, this is a good read with helpful comparisons that really make you think about design. If I could only get as far as generating error messages from my current project... At least they will give me something to read on the train.
