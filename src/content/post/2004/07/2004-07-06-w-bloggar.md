Started using the [:: w.bloggar ::](http://wbloggar.com/) windows based desktop blogger client. So far so good. Though the client only supports a subset of the features available in [Moveable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/), however it is very convienient to do quick blog entries. There are several media player plugin available, but I was thinking it might be cool to write a GPS plugin so that my co-ordinates are recorded with each entry.

I've been considering creating a map of the earth showing my previous locations, only thing putting me off is, a) my usual laziness and b) possible security implications (I am in foobar if anyone fancies robbing my house tonight etc...) Maybe I could do it with a time delay?

Anyway, going to try w.bloggar for a few weeks and see what happens. Will be interesting to try it in offline mode...
