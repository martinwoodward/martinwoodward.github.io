[](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007102860/woodwardwebcom) Got given this [fantastic book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007102860/woodwardwebcom) by my wife. It is a very interesting account of the trade in ice from America to rest of the world. This explains why the British are soo stingy when it comes to ice in drinks and why every fridge in America has an ice machine and why us brits like warm flat bitter instead of ice cold largers. Doesn't explain all you can drink soda's though. Well worth a read.
