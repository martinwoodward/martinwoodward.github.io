Been using the Beta version of [Intellij 4.0](http://www.intellij.com) on my last project. It is now on late release candidate builds and is fantastic. Previously I was an Eclipse fan, however this version has me sold.

Haven't tried out the [generics](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=14) support for [Java 1.5](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/) yet, but I've heard so many people talking about it I think I may have to see what the fuss is about.

[Brian Coyner](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/1078) seems to agree with me in his review [O'Reilly Network: IDEA 4.0 - Is It Worth The Money? [Jan. 23, 2004]](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4268)
