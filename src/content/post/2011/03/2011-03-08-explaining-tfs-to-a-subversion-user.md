In my travels I often run into former Subversion users coming to Team Foundation Server and struggling to come to terms with the differences in the version control model employed by TFS.  [Ed Hintz posted a recent blog post that is very good](http://tinyurl.com/svn2tfs), but as someone who’s used many version control systems in the past (including Subversion) I’ve put together the following deck over the years that I use when giving people advance warning about the differences between the two.  I recently updated my deck based on the latest power tools release and including some of Ed’s points.  Speaking with a few folks at the recent MVP Summit it seemed like this deck might be useful for others so sharing it here:  

Note that I’m just a developer who likes TFS so much he got a job working on the team.  I’m not a marketing person or anything so this is very much a pragmatic view as to why it is different and what you should watch out for – it assumes that you are already motived to *want* to move (i.e. there are no slides saying why TFS is great and why you might want to switch etc).  If you find this useful then feel free to use – if you make any improvements then let me know as I’m always keen to make it better.
