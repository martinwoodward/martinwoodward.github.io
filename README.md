# Martin Woodward's Personal Blog

This is the personal blog website of Martin Woodward, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/)

## About

This site serves as Martin Woodward's digital home, featuring blog posts, thoughts, and insights. 

## Template

This project is based on the **Logbook Astro** template by Themefisher. You can find the complete documentation and template details at:
[https://docs.themefisher.com/logbook-astro/](https://docs.themefisher.com/logbook-astro/)

## Tech Stack

- **[Astro](https://astro.build/)** - Static Site Generator
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)** - Markdown with JSX support

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** (if working from a remote repository):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd woodwardweb
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:4321` to see the site running locally.

### Development Container (Recommended)

For a consistent development experience, this repository includes a VS Code development container configuration:

1. **Open in VS Code** with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed
2. **Reopen in Container** when prompted (or use Command Palette: "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container")
3. **Automatic setup** - dependencies are installed automatically and VS Code is configured with Astro-specific extensions

This provides:
- Node.js 20 environment
- Pre-configured VS Code extensions for Astro, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MDX
- Automatic port forwarding for the development server
- Consistent development environment across all contributors

See [.devcontainer/README.md](.devcontainer/README.md) for detailed information.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the site for production (includes OG image generation)
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally
- `npm run astro` - Run Astro CLI commands
- `npm run generate-og-images` - Generate PNG files from OG image templates (automatically run during build)

### Development Workflow

1. **Content**: Add new blog posts and pages in the `src/content/` directory
2. **Styling**: Customize styles in the `src/styles/` directory
3. **Components**: Create or modify Astro components in `src/layouts/components/`
4. **Configuration**: Update site settings in `src/config/` files

## Open Graph Image Generation

This site automatically generates custom Open Graph (OG) images for each blog post to enhance social media sharing. Each post gets a unique image featuring the post title, description, categories, and author information.

**Key files:**
- `src/pages/api/og/[...slug].png.ts` - Main template and styling
- `src/lib/utils/ogImageUtils.ts` - Utility functions
- `scripts/generate-og-images.js` - Build-time PNG conversion

### How It Works

- **Development**: During `npm run dev`, OG images are served as HTML previews
- **Production**: During `npm run build`, HTML templates are converted to PNG images using Puppeteer
- **Static Pages**: Homepage and about page use the static `/images/og-image.png`

### Previewing OG Images

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **View the preview page**:
   Visit `http://localhost:4321/og-preview` to see all OG images

3. **View individual images**:
   Visit `/api/og/{post-slug}.png` for specific posts

### Customizing OG Images

To modify the OG image template:

1. **Edit the template**: Modify `src/pages/api/og/[...slug].png.ts`
2. **Update styles**: Customize the CSS within the `generateOGImageHTML()` function

### Configuration

The site's configuration is managed through several JSON files in the `src/config/` directory:

- **`config.json`** - General site settings and metadata
- **`menu.json`** - Navigation menu structure
- **`social.json`** - Social media links and profiles
- **`theme.json`** - Visual theme configuration (colors, fonts, typography)

#### Theme Configuration

The site's visual appearance is defined in [`src/config/theme.json`](src/config/theme.json). This file controls:

- **Colors**: Primary theme colors, background colors, border colors, and text colors
- **Fonts**: Font families (primary and secondary) with their types and weights  
- **Typography**: Base font size and scaling ratio

To customize the site's appearance, modify the values in `theme.json`:

```json
{
  "colors": {
    "default": {
      "theme_color": {
        "primary": "#ce8460",    // Primary brand color
        "body": "#fff",          // Background color
        "border": "#ddd",        // Border color
        "light": "#f0f0f0"       // Light accent color
      },
      "text_color": {
        "text": "#696c6d",       // Default text color
        "text-dark": "#1c1d1f",  // Dark text color
        "text-light": "#888c8e"  // Light text color
      }
    }
  },
  "fonts": {
    "font_family": {
      "primary": "Mona Sans:wght@400",
      "secondary": "Hubot Sans:wght@400"
    },
    "font_size": { 
      "base": "16",     // Base font size in pixels
      "scale": "1.2"    // Typography scale ratio
    }
  }
}
```

## Automation & Agentic Workflows

This repository includes experimental **Agentic Workflows** - AI-powered automation workflows that help with repository maintenance:

- 🔄 **Dependabot Auto-Merge**: Automatically approves and merges safe dependency updates
- 🏷️ **Issue Triage**: Categorizes and analyzes new issues with helpful context
- 🏥 **CI Doctor**: Investigates and diagnoses CI/CD failures automatically
- ✍️ **PR Description Enhancer**: Adds helpful context to pull request descriptions

These workflows are defined in natural language (Markdown) and compiled to GitHub Actions using the [gh-aw](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw) tool.

**To enable these workflows**, see [.github/workflows/AGENTIC_WORKFLOWS.md](.github/workflows/AGENTIC_WORKFLOWS.md) for complete setup instructions.

**Note**: These are optional experimental features. The site works perfectly without them, but they can help reduce maintenance burden if you choose to use them.

## Deployment
Build the site for production with:
```bash
npm run build
```

The built site will be output to the `dist/` directory.
